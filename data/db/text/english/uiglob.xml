	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.APEX">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strikecraft support.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Apex structures allow the requisition of Banshee, Shroud, and Blisterback flyers and unlocks their upgrade options. Multiple Apexes in an Outpost reduces flying vehicle requisition time.

The Banished are masters of taking control of the skies and seizing the initiative to conduct their missions. These eyes and talons of the Banished protect Atriox’s extraction and control operations on the Ark from the installation’s aggressive Sentinels and the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s UNSC forces. Most of the Apex personnel are in the employ of the mercenary Shipmaster, though they are utterly reliant on parts, vehicles, and armaments provided by their Brute patrons.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.BASECOMPLEX">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extraction and domination.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Resource-gathering Outposts are deployed by Lich dropships. Once the Outpost’s structures are assembled basic vehicles and infantry can be requisitioned. Four slots are available for building Turrets. Upgrading the Outpost to a Stronghold allows basic infantry to be deployed, while the Citadel and Fortress expansions make additional units available. Each upgrade opens additional build locations for support structures.

The Banished have perfected their strip-mining and rapid assault and extraction efforts over a decade of raiding Covenant and other targets. Each outpost is an invasive engine of exploitation, controlled by rapacious overseers who seek to siphon the riches of the Ark in pursuit of Atriox’s grand plans for domination and glory. Though they lack the military efficiency of their UNSC counterparts, the Banished’s outposts advance plans that extend far beyond the battlefield, and even beyond the Ark itself.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.CLOAKGENERATOR">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stealth and deception field.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Used by the Banished to hide from wrathful Covenant eyes in their early days, the Cloaking Generator is a reverse-engineered version of the stealth pylons used by the Covenant. When built, the Cloaking Generator disguises the presence of the Outpost with a combination of active camouflage and distortion jammers. Even if the Outpost is detected it cannot be directly targeted without the aid of nearby scout units with hyperscanners.

The Banished are never subtle, but they appreciate the power of stealth and ambush. Long years of evading the Covenant’s enforcers has made Atriox an adept master of stealth warfare when it serves his needs. Further improvements in Banished multi-modal stealth and jamming technology come from their use of the Engineers, who have been coerced into making modifications that suit the rather blunt ministrations of their Brute operators.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.FOUNDRY">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vehicle fabrication.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

The Garage and its kit assembly line allows the requisition of Ghost, Wraith, and Locust vehicles and unlocks their upgrade options. The Foundry is critical to the creation of combat and support vehicles that the Outpost overseer can use to better exploit his surroundings and eliminate UNSC opposition to the Banished’s plans.

The Banished were raiders and reavers for years, until the breaking of the Covenant allowed them to consolidate and build themselves into a true power in their own right. Atriox’s brilliant strategies are unconventional when necessary and imitative when efficient – for he will adopt whatever techniques and technologies he has to in order to guarantee victory. His use of Engineers and compact forges in forward bases would have been considered unorthodox – even heretical – under the Covenant’s traditional war creed, but those days are past.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.HARVESTER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supply acquisition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Harvesters are extraction sites that delve into the Ark’s interior to tap raw feedstock that is then converted into Supplies used by the Banished. To meet ever-increasing production quotas, the Augmented Harvester upgrade is needed, which accelerates Supply generation.

The Ark belongs to Atriox, all others in the Banished are entitled only to the scraps he deems fit for their hands.  The Harvesters are but one link in a chain that ultimately extends from the Ark to the Banished forces carrying out other phases of his plan in the Orion Arm of the galaxy. Though important, ultimately every outpost is expendable, and talented overseers can parlay even seeming defeat into praise and promotion if they exceed Atriox’s estimates for harvested profit when they come under attack.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.MINIBASE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expansion outposts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Minibase outposts have an armory for equipping basic infantry, and slots for one, two, or three additional support buildings. 

Each Banished minibase is the shared command of two fallen Jiralhanae warlords who have failed Atriox in some major – but redeemable – way. Each competes to control the majority share of resources sent back to the Enduring Conviction. When their tally of contributions is totaled by the overseer, only the most competent is allowed to return to Atriox’s chieftain council, while the loser is condemned to serve as a Grunt supervisor.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.POWEREXTRACTOR">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power accumulation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Massive channels for power criss-cross the Ark, and carefully sited facilities can dig into these channels and safely siphon a tiny fraction of their potential, which is accumulated as Power. The Augmented Extractor upgrade significantly improves Power collection, which is of vital importance when threats to the Banished and their mission begin to multiply.

The siphoning and filtering of energy from the Ark is not subtle, but it is surprisingly efficient and causes only relatively small disturbances in the installation’s ambient security grid. Nevertheless, no power extraction facility operates for long without attracting the attention of Aggressor Sentinels, which begin to escalate the outpost’s threat level to the Ark and the scale of the reaction.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.RAIDCAMP">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Infantry staging area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Troops and their support equipment arrive in the Outpost at the Raid Camp, where warriors can stoke their bloodlust before battle and thralls are penned while they wait for a mission. The Raid Camp allows the requisition of infantry and unlocks their upgrade options. Multiple Raid Camps in an Outpost reduces infantry requisition time.

Raid Camps serve as a combination of briefing room, feasting hall, and place of judgment, and only warriors are allowed full movement within. During battle each one is a riot of activity, with battle roars and the cacophony of Brutes jostling each other while they don battleplate and test the blades of their weapons on the Grunts or each other.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.SENSORTOWER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atriox’s observation platforms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Sensor Tower is the physical embodiment of Atriox’s watchful presence in every Outpost. It is through the Sensor Tower that the Banished assess the local battlefield and detect nearby cloaked units. Additional Sensor Towers extends the cloak detection range and view of the Outpost’s surrounding area. Sensor Towers occupy a Turret slot.

Atriox’s agents are ever-alert for schism and disloyalty, and his chosen keep watch on the Banished battlenet for discordant voices, but it is through the sensor tower network that the Banished maintain hyper-awareness of the battlefield.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.SHIELDGENERATOR">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heavy energy shield.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Shield Generator creates a heavy dissipative energy shield around the Outpost. Though expensive, the shield will automatically regenerate over time if it is damaged. Each Shield Generator occupies a Turret slot.

The shield generator systems used by the Banished are far more powerful than their crude appearance would suggest, for they are based on Forerunner technologies that had been locked behind walls of tradition and taboo in the Covenant’s distant past. The Banished reject the idea of taboo and have been busy combing the black markets of Venezia and other outlaw rimworlds looking for further secrets of the ancients that can be exploited in the modern era.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.STRONGHOLD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Multi-purpose staging area for Strongholds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

These bases define the win conditions of the Strongholds mode. Each Stronghold has infantry, air, and vehicle support structures already attached. Capturing Strongholds increases population capacity. 

Atriox sees little value in simulation training, preferring to blood his warriors in actual combat. Pain and fear are the best teachers, for what price is there to failure in the sterile realm of simulations and shadow-enemies? However, there are occasions when monitoring and screening are useful in identifying recruits that have the talent needed to lead Banished forces, and what better test for a new Banished lieutenant than a Stronghold on the chaotic front line?</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.TURRET">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defense emplacements.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Weapon towers around the Outpost deter attack from the UNSC, Sentinels, and rival overseers who hope to capitalize on momentary weaknesses. Most Outposts can fit up to four Turrets. Each Turret can be upgraded to be more effective against aircraft, vehicles, and infantry. Unlike UNSC turrets, these upgrades can be combined.

Banished turrets start as moderately effective defensive structures, but they can be improved as time and resources allow. Canny overseers do not attempt to upgrade every turret to its full potential all at once, instead taking advantage of momentary surpluses and keen tactical analysis to upgrade based on current threats. Fully upgraded Banished turrets are extremely deadly, and only the most foolish UNSC commander would run directly at a fully upgraded defense line. But do not assume the Banished will be content to wait behind their turrets, Atriox commands that the best defense is always a good offense.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDBAN.BODY.WARCOUNCIL">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Requisition and tech upgrade structure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

With its construction of a War Council the Outpost overseer is authorized to unlock structure, training time, and population capacity upgrades. It also allows the requisition of Honor Guard or Warlords. The overseer is warned that inefficiency is punishable by fates worse than death, and the War Council should only be built once the Outpost’s salvage and extraction operation is already in place.

The War Council is a physical symbol of ascension in the twisted meritocracy of the Banished, and overseers are constantly in competition to amass the resources needed to create this structure and lure elite warriors into their service. Successful completion of their assigned tasks is only the minimum expected of Atriox’s lieutenants, and the assistance of the Banished’s elite are necessary to accumulate victories and additional resources that will raise their status even further.</str>

As the Ark’s name suggests, it was designed to play host to an incredible variety of life collected from across the galaxy. This almost inconceivable volume of biodiversity necessitated a flexible environmental system on the Ark as the Forerunners prepared for the galactic reseeding of life after the Halo Array was activated. 

On a practical level this meant that all habitable surface area on the Ark could be covered in an environment to match any life-sustaining planet in the galaxy. 

Atmospheres, soil and vegetation makeups, bodies of water or other liquids, and even gravitational conditions could be custom-set in areas as large or as small as needed to sustain collected specimens from a particular planet.

These environmental settings are modified using a network of Control Towers. These towers generate and maintain the surrounding environment around by repurposing preassembled landscape blocks, adjust hydrological features and atmosphere composition for optimal growth conditions, and ensure that invasive species from connected Refugia are removed or eliminated. In addition, low-order life necessary to replicate a functioning biome can also be grown at each Control Tower, using the Ark’s vast genomic archive.

When an environment is complete, only a small percentage of each Control Tower remains visible above ground in order to minimize interference with the new local wildlife while still allowing for data gathering on the surrounding area.

Today, these Control Towers lie mostly dormant. But with new visitors to the Ark and the possibility of new uses for the Ark’s scientific and military capabilities, the towers offer literally world-building power to whoever controls this ancient installation.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDFORE.BODY.POWERNODE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power resource point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The Forerunners built the Ark to be completely self-sustaining, and much of its power lies in the vast subterranean web of power structures beneath its surface. These external power nodes were designed to provide auxiliary power during repairs or emergencies, giving those in control of them a steady flow of &lt;b&gt;power resources.&lt;/b&gt;

On this remote installation, light years from any support, both the UNSC and the Banished have realized the strategic importance of Forerunner power nodes. Eschewing the Covenant’s reverence for Forerunner artifacts, Atriox has no compunction of taking control of them for his own ends, and many a battle involves a desperate scramble to capture power nodes before the enemy can.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDFORE.BODY.RETRIEVERSENTINEL">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extremely powerful Forerunner drone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Ark’s Retriever Sentinels are among the most powerful Forerunner drones, their primary purpose being the mining of the Foundry in the creation of Halos and Ark maintenance. However, like all Forerunner drones, they can also be used to defend the Ark by turning its &lt;b&gt;sentinel beams&lt;/b&gt; on anyone who threatens it.

The Retriever Sentinels played an important part in repairing the Ark after the events of 2552 in the final battle between the UNSC and the Covenant. UNSC scientists at the Henry Lamb Research outpost reactivated the dormant retrievers and watched in awe as the Ark was restored to its former glories. Sadly, war has once again come to the Ark, but the Forerunner drones built to protect it will stand fast and push back against any and all invaders.</str>

	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.AIRPAD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aircraft landing pads and hangars.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Airpads are firebase support structures that allows the requisition of Hornet, Nightingale, and Vulture flyers from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; and unlocks their upgrade options. Multiple Airpads in a firebase reduces flying vehicle requisition time.

Expeditionary airpads house the maintenance crews and equipment needed to assemble, repair, refuel, and rearm UNSC aircraft. Airpads also support the force commander with sensor feeds and intelligence uplinks which allow for proper battlespace deconfliction, kill chain assignment, and other aerospace management tasks.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.ARMORY">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Requisition and tech upgrade structure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Armory structures contain advanced manufacturing modules and electronic support measures that unlock structure, training time, and population capacity upgrades. Construction of an Armory allows the requisition of UNSC Spartans and Operatives to the battlefield, as well as deployment of the Condor gunship. These are key facilities for a UNSC field commander, though their full potential is only unlocked once sufficient resources are available.

The Armory contains specialized machinery and robotic assemblers needed to support the logistical upgrades Isabel has added to the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;, as well as additional communication and sensor systems to expand the force commander’s option when assembling battle groups.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.BARRACKS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Infantry staging area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Infantry shipped down from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; muster in the firebase’s Barracks. The Barracks allows the requisition of Hellbringers, Cyclops, and Snipers and unlocks their upgrade options. Multiple Barracks in a firebase reduces infantry requisition time.

Army and Marine Corps troopers are detached (“chopped”) from their parent unit aboard the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; and deployed to reinforce key firebases on the Ark’s surface, replacing injured personnel who are then medevac’d out of the combat zone. While they await assignment to a fireteam, the “new blood” acclimate and review tactical situation reports in the barracks, which doubles as a recreation area and messhall during lulls in battle.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.BASECOMPLEX">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forward operating base.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Lightweight firebase modules can be delivered directly to the battlefield by Condor dropships. The modules then unpack and can assemble basic structures and UNSC weapons systems, protected by up to four turret emplacements. Upgrading the firebase to a combat station allows basic infantry to be deployed, while the command center and headquarters expansions make additional units available. Each upgrade also opens additional build locations for support structures.

The &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s expeditionary firebases trade a portion of the original Heron-transported “pod” system’s operational flexibility for substantial mass and resource savings. Unlike the older pod firebases, additional pre-manufactured base structures must be transported to the firebase rather than assembled on-site, but this method saves irreplaceable strategic resources aboard the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;. The older pod bases remain in reserve, with the Heron dropships used exclusively for mass deployment of cargo and troops in secured rear areas.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.GARAGE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vehicle factory.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Garage and its kit assembly line allows the requisition of Warthog, Scorpion, Wolverine, and Kodiak armored vehicles from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; and unlocks their upgrade options. This should be one of the first infrastructure upgrades made to a new firebase, as the Garage constructs vehicles that will remain useful throughout the mission. Multiple Garages in a firebase reduces armored vehicle requisition time.

Pelicans and Darters are not rated for transatmospheric transport of most UNSC combat vehicles, due to the potential for damage and loss of control during reentry. While travel to and from the surface of the Ark is dramatically simplified due to its artificial gravity, the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; is not currently configured to make effective use of this deployment method. Instead, UNSC doctrine states that when use of heavy lifters and surface staging areas is not available, combat vehicles can be partially disassembled, “crated” for transport, and then reassembled near the combat zone.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.GENERATOR">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power generators.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Each firebase has an integral power plant to meet immediate needs, but additional Generators are needed for the accumulation of Power used for unit assembly and purchase of upgrades. A Generator should be among the first support structures added to a new firebase. The Advanced Generator upgrade significantly improves Power output.

The older “pod” bases deployed by the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; used hydrogen-burning reactors for power, which required expensive and bulky fuel storage and safety systems. However, new firebase structures require far less power to function compared to the legacy designs, allowing Isabel to adapt modern UNSC vertical axis turbines as a more sustainable replacement.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.MINIBASE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expansion outposts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Minibase outposts have an armory for equipping basic infantry, and slots for one, two, or three additional support buildings. 

Minibases are deployed from Condors to opportunistic locations in the operations zone. Each minibase is built using stripped-down modules assembled and packed aboard the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; before being loaded on the dropship for deployment. Minibases that survive a battle become unmanned sensor and communication relays in the ever-growing system of control nodes being extended across the Ark by Isabel and Captain Cutter.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.SIEGETURRET">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artillery turret.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Siege Turrets are long-range artillery systems built to counter enemy bombardment platforms that would otherwise be out of range of standard Turrets. These structures occupy a turret slot.

The UNSC learned the dangers of relying on fixed installations against enemies with orbital fire support early in the war against the Covenant. The modular firebase system was developed in response to pinpoint Covenant targeting of large military command and control installations with orbital strikes, and the inability of standard counterbattery systems to detect, deflect, or defeat plasma-based artillery bombardment. The siege turrets can do little against threats in the orbital high ground, but they will deter enemy artillery systems by matching or exceeding their range, making ad-hoc assaults on UNSC firebases a costly proposition.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.STRONGHOLD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Multi-purpose staging area for Strongholds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Based on rapid-deploy fortifications in the War Games training simulations set up by Isabel, these bases are vitally important objectives that define the win conditions of the Strongholds training mode. Each Stronghold has infantry, air, and vehicle support structures already attached. Each captured Stronghold increases population capacity. 

The concept of Strongholds began in War Games, but Isabel continues to run optimization routines on the design templates she uploaded to the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s databanks. Isabel has gleaned many novel upgrades from the logs kept by the ship’s previous AI, Serina, of the many prior engagements of the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.SUPPLYPAD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supply landing zones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Supply Pads allow the firebase to receive a constant flow of Supplies from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;. These are vital logistical ports for UNSC combat operations, and the force commander should carefully weigh the cost of delaying their construction. To sustain high-tempo missions the Heavy Supply Pad upgrade is needed, which accelerates Supply generation. Though important to the war effort, too many Supply Pads can impede efficiency if they take the place of unit-creating structures – you can’t win a fight with just raw materials!

While some useful assets can be salvaged and tapped on the Ark’s surface, the bulk of the UNSC’s supplies must still be delivered from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;. Sustaining combat operations on the Ark would be practically impossible without the use of supply pads to quickly unload cargo from dropships and the on-site direction of logisticians to efficiently redistribute the incoming food, ammunition, spare parts, and power cells.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.TURRET">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defense emplacements.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 

Automated weapon towers are installed around UNSC firebases to deter attack. Most firebase facilities have power and control hookups prearranged for up to four Turrets. Turrets can engage a variety of targets, but each can be upgraded to specialize against one particular threat: aircraft, vehicle, or infantry.

The base towers used by the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; are relics of a defensive-in-depth tactical doctrine the UNSC was eventually forced to abandon as the Covenant War ground down Humanity’s armies and industrial centers. Turrets are still invaluable tools for the field commander’s arsenal on the Ark, however, freeing up troops and vehicles needed to find, fix, and destroy the Banished.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.BUILDUNSC.BODY.WATCHTOWER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sensor tower.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Watchtower is an elevated sensor platform that increase the firebase’s line of sight and can detect nearby cloaked units. Additional Watchtowers extend the cloak detection range. Each Watchtower occupies a turret slot.

The multi-modal stealth and jamming systems employed by the Covenant and Banished are a significant strategic challenge for the UNSC. Though improvements have been made, there is still a significant capability gap in detection range versus cloaking capabilities. Nevertheless, with microdrone clouds and hyperscanner technology acquired from former Covenant sources, UNSC firebases can deploy a short-range sensor network that will reliably reveal enemies otherwise shrouded by cloaking generators and active camouflage. Once detected, their location can be shared to all friendly units for targeting.</str>

It has been nearly two months since the attack and our group has atrophied to eight. Four disappeared one night while the rest of us slept. Each of them had argued with us that week about returning to the base to see if they could reopen the portal, so I can only hope they left in the night to go back without us. Three we lost to thirst, hunger and the elements. I am ashamed to notice that our smaller group is now more manageable - finding food and water is easier with fewer mouths to feed.

During this time, the invaders have not been idle. Yesterday we stumbled upon what seems to be some kind of transport route, moving resources they’re mining to supply their forces. The lanes sprawl out across the land like a spider web, with all the grace and aesthetics of Forerunner design. 

We rested and argued for a while about which direction to head in. There was a real danger we could accidentally stumble upon an enemy base, but that could also lead to supplies, perhaps even a vehicle we could steal. 

We are hungry and exhausted and cannot last much longer in the wild. One of us, Brewer, said as much and not for the first time raved about surrendering. We thought we had talked him out of it but the next morning he had gone. If he had successfully surrendered he could have given away our position, so we had no choice but to start moving immediately. 

We look for cover but avoid the trees because I have seen strange shimmers and movement amongst them. I am scared and tired and want to give up. But that won’t get me back to you.</str>

How my ancestors would envy me. I have walked within the cavernous corridors of one of the fabled cartographers on the Ark, a place long considered only in legends. I still feel strong emotions here, for so much of the history of our race is intrinsically bound up in it. But those emotions are not those of my ancestors. 

No longer do I feel the religious reverence or feel humbled in the presence of the ancient’s structures and monuments. Gone is the comforting certainty of a shared destiny and the peace and connection between brothers that comes with it.  Instead, when I close my eyes and breathe in the air around me, I smell only machines. I remember how many hundreds of thousands of our warriors fell – how many were sacrificed for a journey that never existed. I feel anger and a deep sorrow for a race that has lost its way. 

Even now, long after the Prophets’ lies have been revealed, the ripples of that revelation continue. I have become estranged from my family, who even after the truth has come to light, refuse to fully renounce the ancient doctrines I have brought shame upon our name by offering up my blade alongside my brothers…for hire.

Battle and conflict is in our blood, our very way of life, and that is the only truth I can now find. I cannot wait for another holy war, not will I be duped again. With Atriox there are no lies; he speaks like a warrior. He wished to break free from the yoke of the Prophets, so he did. Would that we had joined him earlier. Now he offers us a way to keep our ship and our crew together and I can think of nothing more truthful to fight for right now. The Shipmaster brought us through the war and to this place alive where so many others have perished. He asked us to follow him once more, and I will.</str>

As we continue our campaign against Atriox and the Banished, I continue to discover more about the Forerunner’s history and the Ark. Ever since Red Team rescued Isabel, I’ve been pouring over her notes, trying to catch up on as much history as possible. There are so many intertwining stories and revelations that each new piece only throws up more questions, sending me darting down another branch of investigation.

I am trying my best to remain focused, but it’s hard not to wander occasionally when something intrigues. However, my passion is tempered with my responsibilities to the rest of the crew. 

Although I am still a civilian here, I’ve been through too much with these people to not consider the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; home and its crew family. Now I can help them by beating Atriox in the race for knowledge. It’s the only way to keep them…and me…alive.</str>

Incoming: R-5557-4452: We have spotted a small human vehicle force on the southern spire near the ruined human settlement. No sign of a larger strike force, but all Banished forces in the area should be ready to mobilize in the event of a larger human assault.

Incoming: R-6001-4452: Humans routed from the area, many dead. One of their Demons immobilized, the other missing, presumed dead. We have secured prisoners for interrogation and sport.

Incoming: R-6029-4452: The humans launched a surprise assault against Decimus’ salvage operation. Superior numbers forced Decimus to return to base. Decimus has been ordered to report to Atriox immediately. All Banished outposts to be on the alert for further human assaults.

Incoming: R-6042-4452: Supply deliveries along the southern Spire supply-line have slowed significantly. Rumors delivery outposts have been lost to human forces. Temporary re-route of emergency supplies underway. We also have reports of several communication blackouts at one of our settlements, seems to be a small second force operating independently of the main enemy force. Reinforcements sent down to bolster our bases there and eradicate this problem.

Incoming: R-6066-5012: Cartographer lost to the enemy. It is believed humans managed to recover information from Decimus’ base and location of portals controls now compromised. Decimus reassigned to protect likely portal targets.

Incoming: R-688-5014: Loss of captives to the guerrilla force. No survivors, but garbled reports from the Unggoy forces of a ‘[UNKNOWN TRANSLATION]’.

Attention all Unggoy! 

As captain of this pitiless rabble I have the displeasure of having quarters close to you whelps, and so my ears are tainted with every cowardly whisper and idiotic rumor that is spread among your number! Recently, a poisonous tale has become popular among you little ones, a tale that has resulted in two – TWO – attempted desertions! This threatens to undermine my authority and is an insult to the name of the Banished and Atriox himself. I am here to crush that rumor before it results in any more disobedience.

The rumor is of an enemy warrior, so called ‘The [UNKNOWN TRANSLATION]’. It has been said that this ‘[UNKNOWN TRANSLATION]’ is responsible for the deaths of our comrades at the ancient’s water treatment structure and the loss of several captives. According to you superstitious fools, the ‘[UNKNOWN TRANSLATION]’ single-handedly fought our bravest Jiralhanae before freeing the human captives and then led a path of destruction leaving not one of our warriors standing! The worst versions have the [UNKNOWN TRANSLATION] being unstoppable, a ghost or even the same Demon that defeated the Covenant curs! 

This ends now. The death of our warriors and loss of captives was due to an accident, probably caused by some lazy Unggoy neglecting its duty! From now on, any talk of this phantom [UNKNOWN TRANSLATION] will result in several of you pathetic creatures being hurled to the bottom of the nearest ancient chasm as a warning. Let that be the end of it.

One last thing – the execution of the deserters will happen in one hour, all are to attend.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.CAMPAIGN.BODY.HOLDTHELINE.M05">&lt;b&gt;Professor Ellen Anders, Civilian Consultant 500493, Spirit of Fire. Date: 03/30/2559&lt;/b&gt;

I’ve been examining data pulled from the amber lake and cross-referencing it against Isabel’s information banks on the Forerunners.  I couldn’t help but draw a parallel with the amber that fossilized long dead species on Earth. Except on Earth, those biological relics were preserved where they fell. Here, despite all appearances, everything has been constructed and planned. The Ark is part of a larger plan spun by the Librarian, and the UNSC archives say this was a plan for humanity.

New Mombasa was the first city to have an orbital elevator, but also the site of the portal that first led to the Ark. Was this all part of the Librarian’s plans? Could she have manipulated our evolution just so we would discover the portal? 

If we are to be these ‘Reclaimers’ as so often claimed, does that mean we are predestined to follow a set path or are we merely being guided to assume a greater role in the universe? On the one hand, it is thrilling that we may be finally uncovering the great questions as to why we are here, but it also scares me. It feels like we’re preserved specimens under the surface of the amber lake, observed by some great, unknown eye.

I need to get back to work, but I have to come back to this when we have time. If we have time. Back to it, Ellen.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.CAMPAIGN.BODY.LASTSTAND.M09">&lt;b&gt;Captain James Cutter, SN: 01730-58392-JC, Spirit of Fire, Date: 04/02/2559&lt;/b&gt;

Once again, I say goodbye to a colleague and friend. The new Halo installation has disappeared through the slipspace portal, far out of reach of Atriox’s hands, but it took Professor Anders with it. I know the Professor will be okay, her intelligence and resourcefulness will see her safely back to her lab in no time, but I will miss her and our family is a little smaller without her.

But there is plenty to keep us occupied here. The portal to Earth is still closed, and as far as I’m concerned it should remain so until we fully evaluate the threat the Banished pose to it. However, I have ordered Isabel to start investigating the portal’s controls in the event that we need to open – or close – it again in the future. The Ark is our new home for now and the Banished threat is too great to leave it unguarded until we reestablish contact with the UNSC forces back home. 

For now, Atriox seems to be licking his wounds, but we know he still has forces active in the darkest corners of the Ark and it won’t be long before he mobilizes them once again. This time we’ll be ready for him.

Yes, I have said goodbye to another friend and we are again cut off from the rest of humanity, but this time it’s different. We know that the Covenant war has been won and a new future awaits us back home – perhaps our families as well. For now, we have a new purpose, something to fight for. And we’ll do it together on our new home.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.CAMPAIGN.BODY.LIGHTSOUT.M04">&lt;b&gt;From the journal of Orda Val ‘Saham, Sangheili Guard 03/30/2559&lt;/b&gt;

This may be my last entry. The humans reached the Cartographer and by now have no doubt discovered the location of Atriox’s reinforcement portals. I admire the humans’ courage and skill as warriors; they are just one ship, but fight as fiercely as an entire fleet! If their leader is as shrewd as he has appeared so far, then he will understand the value of the portals and they must be the human’s next target. They’re likely already striking out to destroy them.

I have been ordered to defend the portals and must report to Decimus. This gives me grave concern. When we first arrived at the Cartographer, I was among the Sangheili who were to sweep the area for hostile elements and as such I was privy to Decimus’ movements. 

He is Atriox’s right-hand and pledges loyalty to the Banished, but as I watched him walk among the ancient’s halls I recognized the awe and reverence in his eyes that I once saw among my own clan. I saw that fatal longing, that tragic need to be once more struck dumb and blind by the promise of a wondrous destiny. If we are to succeed, Decimus must purge these old conflicts from his thoughts. A warrior’s heart must be certain if he is to survive, as doubt is a surer killer than the sharpest blade.</str>

Fifteen of us managed to escape the attack. I still don’t know if anyone else made it out. 

We were returning from a survey expedition when we heard the first explosions. 

I ran back, following the plumes of black smoke rising into the evening sky from just over the bluff. Sounds of UNSC gunfire were soon drowned out by the too-familiar whine of plasma weapons, confirming our worst fears. 

As we looked down at the horror below, we saw several hulking outlines move amongst the shadows. Jiralhanae, I think. Brutes. They were everywhere. The air was filled with the smell of burning ozone as a couple of bright, electric blue shapes arced their way towards us. We scattered as the plasma blast hit, vaporizing the trees nearby and showering us with ash and debris.

We instinctively turned and ran. My ears were ringing and the ground shook, but we somehow managed to stay together. I yelled at everyone to keep moving, to not look back no matter what. But when the firing stopped I couldn’t help myself, I turned around and witnessed the orbital plasma bombardment of our home firsthand. It didn’t last long. It didn’t need to. But the finality of it will be forever seared into my memory.

We’ve been on the run for three days now. The grime and smoke and ash clings to our clothes, our hair. We sleep in shifts, but not for very long. Every sound wakes us with a start and we expect to see the enemy bearing down on us.

We don’t know where we’re going but we’ve found some temporary shelter amongst some old wreckage from the last time humanity was here - skeletons of the past. 

I can’t help but think of the people we left behind. Will the Ark simply clean them away as it repairs itself? As if they never existed, layering fresh grass and fauna over their graves until the scars are no longer visible? They should not be forgotten. I think of you and I pray we are not at war again.</str>

This is Senior Chief Petty Officer Alice-130, recording status report. Operating comms silent.

I managed to hold them off as long as I could while the Pelicans carried out Jerome and Douglas, and once they were clear I spotted a Ghost, commandeered it and made for the nearest portal. There was a Brute coming through from the other side, and I have to admit, his surprised expression as he bounced off the front of my Ghost was very satisfying.

The portal transported me a couple of clicks away from the main force, so I stashed the Ghost in a nearby cave and took up a watch. After a couple of hours perched in a small indent of a cliff face, the hostiles had moved on. A caravan detachment had captured some of our troops from back at the outpost and were taking off in another direction of the main force, so I’ve been tracking them, maintaining comms silence until it’s safe to contact the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;.

One more thing – although the hostile forces consisted of both Unggoy and Jiralhanae soldiers they’re not kitted out like any I’ve seen before, and the taking of prisoners is unusual behavior for the Covenant. It’s unclear yet whether this is some kind of subfaction or a new enemy force. I will continue to make and log these reports until contact is reestablished. Alice-130, signing off.</str>

The humans have damaged Installation 00 with their war, like chidddlren allowzed to run rampnt and uncheckedd.

Correction: [Like children allowed to run rampant and unchecked]

Are these truly the ones destined to carry the Mantle? Perhaps it is unwise to question the Librarian’s plans, but one’s thoughts do tend to wander and dwell on forbidden thoughts when one has been left alone for so lone

Correction: [long].

How long has it been now? No matter.

I cannot help but question the wisdom of my masters. After all, there have been countless battles and each time the only difference seems to be the names of those involved. 

Can the universe really be shod and bridled like some common beast simply to serve the wants and needs of petty organic life? I have had time to do little but watch as events unfurl and to my senses there has been no advancement. If a rock is cast into the water, no matter the weight or the force of the one who hurls it, it creates a few ripples quickly subsumed by the calm of the lake itself. Is the purpose then to simply upset the stillness, albeit temporarily? 

If so, then surely it is a selfish, prideful need for immortality in the sentient beings. A need which we should not encourage. After all, they only hurt themselves. 

No, the real truth is that the universe is cyclical and must maintain its stillness, infinitely returning to the source. Installation 00 must be maintained and returned to its former state and those that have done it harm must be dealt with. 

It is time for me to get to work.</str>

The will and resilience of life never ceases to amaze me. Infinite permutations of bacteria, animals, and plants all exist as a direct result of the endless struggle and adaptation against a hostile universe. This installation, light years from the galactic center, is a paragon of that fact. When we first arrived here, the Ark had suffered great wounds from our war against the Covenant, and so we activated dormant Retriever Sentinels and deployed them to strip-mine lifeless planets for the materials needed to repair the installation. Like watching a sleeping giant nudged into wakefulness, the reconstruction slowly reached full automation until we were no longer needed to guide the Sentinels and could simply sit back and record the wonder of a world being reborn.

Isabel, our new smart AI, has embraced our new home with a wonder and enthusiasm that matches our own. She is a young AI and this is her first assignment but even so, her excitement for discovery and investigation is infectious among the team. I even caught Brewer, the most jaded of the scientists here, swapping jokes with her while they worked. Although we are hesitant – and too worldly - about admitting it openly, it feels like we are on the cusp of a new era. (1/3)</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.CAMPAIGN.BODY.THESIGNAL2.PROLOGUEB">The Covenant War often felt impossible to win, or at the very least, would be so prolonged that as a race we would end it exhausted and broken, retreating back to our own galaxy, cowed by the power of a greater enemy. Instead, it proved that there was always hope, and that even enemies can become allies.

Now the war is over and events have brought us to the Ark. Peace reigns, and we have the time and resources to unlock some of the mysteries of the Forerunners. We’ve been mired in war for so long – perhaps now mankind can focus on development, on self-enrichment, for a change.  (2/3)</str>

Only this morning, I watched in awe as giant tectonic plates rearranged, shifted and unfolded to form a new pathway across a chasm. 

My amazement at the size of these things was only matched by the naturalness of the movements, as graceful as a flower opening in time-lapse. If eons-old technology can move with the present, if it can adapt and change to work in harmony with the universe, then perhaps we can learn to evolve as well. (3/3)</str>

Captain, how much longer must we put up with these Sangheili mercenaries? They are as haughty as their kind ever was during the Covenant, despite how they have debased themselves for Atriox.

True, their ship is impressive; when I think of the punishment we dealt to the human’s pitiful outpost great peals of laughter burst from my lips. How they ran like tiny insects, hopelessly lost and panicked as if we had poured boiling water into their dirty little nest! Yes, we burned that place. Of course, many of the Unggoy under our command were obliterated as well, but you cannot have a feast without breaking bones! Our soldiers knew the risks and were willing to die for our goal and the Unggoy – well, they are merely fodder, willing to hurl themselves to their deaths as long as there is someone to command them to do so! 

Not so with these POMPOUS Sangheili! They declined our invitations to celebrate the destruction of the human’s outpost. It is untrustworthy to have mercenaries be so squeamish! War is not about honor, but about who climbs out of the pit alive at the end! The end of the Covenant has freed our race, but it seems to have imprisoned theirs.

That is all, my shift is over and I must go now to find some Unggoys to beat for sport.</str>

This hostile environment, blood-red and battered by harsh winds, is rendered even crueler by the scorched and smoking remains of a Covenant freighter, blasted out of the sky by Forerunner defenses. The impact trench created by the crash leads down into a deep crater, where the force of the collision has destroyed the top layer of the refugia, revealing the proto-Forerunner substructure running underneath.</str>

“I was tired. I signaled to the Grunt on the other side of the door, undid the lock and stepped back, hands held up where it could see me. The Grunt got up slowly and started walking towards it.

I had stumbled upon the abandoned research outpost a couple of days ago after a week in the howling desert wind. My entire squad had been killed in a Banished ambush, but I was saved - then damned - by a sudden sandstorm that covered my escape. Then came a week walking through the biting wind, ears dulled by the constant whine, almost delirious with starvation. I tried to cry when I first saw the outpost, but I was so dehydrated I could only choke out a few guttural noises.

With the researchers long dead the outpost was filthy and a stale smell hung in the air, but the quiet hum of the power systems after the noise of the desert felt like home. I found fresh clothes, enough food stocks for six months and a communication system that I thought I could get working within a few days so I could contact the Spirit of Fire. I ate a large meal, found a cot and fell asleep in seconds.

A crash woke me up, and I crept into the corridor to see a Grunt inside the pantry, searching for supplies - I wasn’t the only one who had gotten lost in the storm. I slammed the door and locked it, trapping the Grunt inside. He spun around, shocked to see someone else and then tried to barge through the door. But it was too heavy. He started pacing around in circles, which is when he saw my gun propped up against the refrigerator inside the pantry. We had a standoff; he was trapped, but I was unarmed and couldn’t get to the food. My only hope was the communications equipment.

After three days without food, I was ravenous and having lapses in concentration. I weighed the risks and decided to let the Grunt out so I could get to the supplies. As he crossed the threshold of the door he triggered the tripwire, setting off the small explosion I had cannibalized from the communications equipment. I dragged his body to the side of the pantry and took a drink from the refrigerator. I wasn’t going to be calling anyone anytime soon - but neither was the Grunt.”

	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.MPMAPS.BODY.BEDROCK">The sub-structure of an incomplete refugia stands ready to continue the Ark’s work.

The Ghost skimmed the surface of the Forerunner terrain of the Ark as its pilot deftly dodged the latest salvo of enemy fire from the Hornets hounding it, effortlessly taking a sudden sharp turn to widen the gap between the pursuers. The Elite at the controls was a confident and experienced driver, a far cry from the Ghost’s first owner.

This particular Ghost first saw service in 2552 on the planet Reach, but it was short-lived. The young Elite who drove it then was overeager and reckless, so sure of the Covenant’s superiority that he rushed ahead of the rest of the squad and was quickly picked off by UNSC sniper fire before being able to baptize the Ghost’s plasma cannons. Now driverless, the Ghost sat out the rest of the battle until being collected and returned to a Covenant dropship.

In 2552, the Ghost and its new rider were deployed to the Ark where it fought in the climactic battle of the Human-Covenant war – this time, piloted by a veteran Jiralhanae warrior. However, despite the Ghost pilot’s combat experience, he was unprepared for the Demon, who surprised the Brute from nowhere and threw his body from the vehicle.

Amazingly, this Demon demonstrated all the skill of a trained Covenant pilot in using the Ghost’s tricky controls, turning the vehicle’s plasma cannons against its own kind and using it as a bludgeoning tool to ram through clusters of shrieking Unggoy. This Demon, the Ghost’s third driver, was the shortest owner and quickly abandoned it once it had started belching smoke from the damage inflicted upon it.

Years of respite from battle followed, as the Ghost lay dormant among the other Covenant wreckage, undisturbed. With the return of humans to the installation, the Ark started rebuilding itself and repairing the damage. Life and fauna returned to the Ark and the Ghost became home to insects and small animals, while creeping weeds grew around and into it, strangling its controls.

Then the Banished arrived and the Ghost was torn free from its resting place and repaired by Huragok savant-technicians, then reshaped to fit a more brutal, battle torn Banished aesthetic and it once again had a driver and a war to fight in.

Now, the Ghost was closing in fast on its target, shades of azure flashing by in a blur as the Elite manipulated it up and down the ramps and curves of the Forerunner terrain. The power resource was now in sight, protected only by a few enemy ground troops. The Elite fired the Ghost’s plasma cannons and forced them to scatter, leaving the resource open for him to capture. The Elite eased off on the accelerator and the Ghost hummed to a slow crawl.

The warning whine of several Hornets came too late, and as they emerged from behind the Forerunner tower, the Elite was cut down in the crossfire of their autocannons and fell from the Ghost’s cockpit. The Hornets continued onto their next target and the Ghost sat silent and awaited its next driver.</str>

“Poor kid never saw it coming.”

Corporal Kyla Emmett pulled the edges of a tattered UNSC banner over the lifeless body of a young Marine they’d all just called “Matthews.” Kyla had seen plenty of action as a member of Boomerang Company – even well before this latest excursion to yet another otherworldly alien installation. The seasoned ODST had expertly dispatched the enemy scout responsible for their party’s latest casualty, but it wouldn’t make a difference in the long run if things didn’t change quick. She was part of a dwindling resistance force stationed at Fort Jordan – a scrappy outpost set up on a strategically-located island on the Ark’s surface. 

“Why are they even here?” Kyla’s thoughts were interrupted by Jacob Arden, a Hellbringer with zero patience and even less of a filter. 

“Probably because we’re still here.”

“Which begs the question…” 

Even behind that gold-mirrored faceplate Kyla knew the facetious face he was making. She ignored him and gave a final once-over at their lifeline – a lone remaining Mastodon APC that allowed them to traverse the artificial island scavenging for supplies. Not to mention, it offered at least some sort of protection from the remaining Banished forces that lingered on with seemingly no other priority than to make their lives miserable. Jacob knew good and damn well why BOTH sides were still there. The UNSC had come here looking to set up camp near a downed Covenant craft in hopes of salvaging anything the technicians on the Spirit of Fire might find useful. Not long after, the Banished came looking for it as well, led by a Jiralhanae warlord who had too much pride to call for backup. Immediately the Banished took down their long-range comms, and a battle of attrition began. For weeks numbers on both sides had been dwindling, and it seemed a final clash was not only inevitable, but soon at hand.  

Kyla was joined by two remaining members of her ODST contingent within Lotus Squad, as well as a specialist sniper, the sardonic Hellbringer, and three – well, make that two now – frontline infantry. A number that made it easy to fit in an M650, but difficult to win any wars. 

“We’re out of time, Corporal.” The transmission came crackling through her headset, carrying the voice of their sniper who had set up shop at the edge of their local comm range in hopes of giving whatever early warning they could. Ristyx was on his way, and most Banished warlords weren’t known for their diplomacy. The corporal slapped the side of the Mastodon and gave a signal to the others. 

“We making another run for it?”

“No Jacob,” Kyla said calmly as her helmet fully polarized. “no more running.”</str>

A clash of familiar and alien environments characterize this battlefield; lush grassland and sandy beaches are punctuated by several monolithic Forerunner structures, creating unnatural ‘islands’ among the landscape. The sleek but complex designs of the Forerunner ramps and lightbridges that branch off from these islands form multiple paths over the natural chasms of the environment as factions clash to gain control over valuable Forerunner resources.</str>

“I watched as my scattered recon team were swiftly picked off one by one by the two Elite Ranger patrols. They must have been watching all along, waiting for us to split up as we scouted the area for power nodes. The Elites had the element of surprise, the numbers and the high ground.

My only advantage was that they hadn’t spotted me yet, but as soon as I took a shot, they’d be able to pinpoint my position. I checked my ammo - six bullets for four Elites. Our Pelican pick up wasn’t scheduled for another hour, and I could follow the Elite’s movements from the glints of light bouncing off their carbines as they reflected the crystals lining the platform. If I didn’t act now, they’d have me pinned.

I reprogrammed my spotter drone to patrol three points on the map and sent it off. As soon as it broke cover, I engaged my cloaking technology and made for the opposite direction. One of the Elites bellowed something and their carbine rounds pinged off the Forerunner structures as they tried to shoot the drone. While they were distracted I made a dash for the nearest teleporter and jumped in. I was lucky, and I appeared above them at a blind spot. I aimed and fired. Even before the Elite hit the ground I had already entered the teleporter and back where I started. 

By now, the Elites had figured out where my shot came from, taken cover and were searching for me, but now I was behind them. I aimed and took out another of them and they yelled in surprise. I ducked back into cover and waited. My drone was now reaching the final point of its patrol and as it floated past the spooked Elites, they overreacted and blasted it out of the sky.

Taking advantage of their panic, I fired off a wild shot to ricochet off some crystals and jumped back through the teleporter as they swung round in the direction of the ricochet. I was back above them again. They were shouting something angrily at each other, and I saw one gesturing towards the teleporter. I took another shot and one of the Elites fell back. The last Elite finally spotted me, but it was too late. He didn’t even get a chance to raise his gun. 

As I collected my team’s tags, I checked my rifle. One bullet left. I figure I’ll save it for the next Elite.”

“The skeletons of wrecked Covenant ships, slowly being buried by shifting sands, should have acted as a warning to us. When I warned the Jiralhanae leading our mining expedition that we should act with caution, he only snorted and called the wrecks merely ‘ghosts of the old war’. The Unggoy chattered amongst themselves nervously, and I knew they too had noticed the charred terrain, pocked by heavy blast points. The Jiralhanae roared and gave the nearest Unggoy a swift kick as a warning to the others, and shot me an angry look for daring to scare his rabble.

When we reached the site, I stayed on guard while the Jiralhanae ordered his Unggoy to prepare the mining equipment. They had just breached the surface when I felt the air move. I screamed a warning and managed to dive into cover as the first salvo exploded the rocky outcropping where I once stood. I lay on the ground, dazed from the blast and smelled a sickening burning odor, followed quickly by a jolt of searing hot pain. My sword arm had been severely burnt and the light from the blast had temporarily blinded me. I heard the Jiralhanae barking orders to his panicked Unggoy, but his cries were quickly cut short by another blast. My sight had cleared enough that I could just make out a large shadow hovering over the panicking Unggoy, who scattered as I sunk into unconsciousness.
 
When I awoke, our attacker had disappeared and the only things left were our mining equipment - damaged beyond use - and the body of the Jiralhanae served as the iris of a newly created crater.”

“The storage facility was only a couple of klicks out as we pushed through the woods, and after a long exhausting march I could feel the rest of the team relax a little. After all the alien sights we had seen, the familiarity of a cool breeze and the smell of those large trees was a comfort, and for a short while we could almost forget where we were. 

That was our first mistake. Something shimmered out of the corner of my eye and lifted Dimitri into the air. He lurched violently to the left as the cloaked Elite swung his sword free of his victim and Floyd shouted ‘Elite!’. We fired off several rounds at the spot where Dimitri had been standing, but the Elite had already melted back into the trees. We still outnumbered him seven to one, but I wasn’t about to follow a cloaked Elite into the trees so he could pick us off one by one. 

We popped our grenades.

A minute later, we slowly pushed through the burning trees, picking splinters out of our uniforms. There was no sign of the Elite, but the shallow stream beyond was streaked with purple blood. I collected Dimitri’s tags and blinked to get the sting of smoke out of my eyes. We wouldn’t forget where we were again.”

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Whatever it is you woke me for it had better be good. I have a 0600 with Zero and I’m going to need my full four hours to keep ahead of them.&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Yes, sir. It’s one of the Unggoy we captured. It’s offering information in exchange for a deal.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] A Grunt? Why are you wasting my time? Those things don’t know HOW to tell the truth. Besides, something that far down the chain won’t have access to plans. Not beyond kitchen duty anyway.&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] You’re right, sir. But it’s not about the Covenant. The Unggoy says he was snatched from the Covenant. You remember the attack on Carter Guard Armory six weeks ago? 

&lt;b&gt;['D'] I’m still trying to make up the losses from the fallout. They took everything we had and left no survivors. I’ve never seen the Covenant take our gear like that before. Are you telling me we have a splinter group to contend with now?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Maybe. Whether they’re our problem too is another matter. I started doing some digging and the group’s targets seem to be chiefly Covenant. I guess hit what you know, eh? Anyway, I pulled the security vids of the raid to get the Unggoy to identify the leader.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] And did the grunt ID? Do we have a visual?&lt;/b&gt; 

['S'] Pulling it up now. It’s a little blurry, but what you’re about to see is the leader, a Jiralhanae, fighting a squad of ODSTs. There’s a lot of blood, sir. It’s not an easy watch. 

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Good lord. Is he beating that ODST with…? Do we have a name?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] We do, sir. From the Unggoy. Says his name is Atriox.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Make sure no one else talks to that grunt. I want this compartmentalized. Some at ONI will see this as a problem to be fixed, not an opportunity. Find out all you can on this Atriox and keep me informed.&lt;/b&gt;</str>

['S'] Sir, did you receive the report on Codename: Slow Dive? I thought you should see it.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] I did, although I’m not sure why I’m looking at it. Hit and run, neutralize Covenant forward outpost...break it down for me, what am I missing? Why is this an ONI concern? Did we lose anything vital?&lt;/b&gt; 

['S'] No sir - in fact we suffered no casualties at all. When the team arrived at the outpost it had already been wiped out. Every Covenant dead, every weapon and vehicle gone. The only vehicles left look to have been sabotaged.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Crossed lines happen all the time. I take it you’ve already had a discrete poke around the other departments. Did we have a Spartan black ops mission there?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] No one’s heard a peep, sir and I was very thorough. I’ve annotated the report for you. The ballistics report confirms the majority of the damage came from spikers, Brute weapons. Remember our discussion about Atriox?

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Ah. You think this could be his work. What did that Grunt call them, ‘The Banished’? Still out there, are they?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Once I saw the ballistics report I requested the last six months of mission reports - under a proxy of course - and I believe I’ve found other similar incidents; five months ago a rookie marine trips an alarm during a mission against a Covenant training camp. The team dig in, fearing the worst but no Covenant troops respond. The team sweep the camp only to find a few dead Sangheili in a warehouse. Everything else is gone, vehicles, weapons, even the rest of the Covenant that were stationed there. Once I started looking I found five other similar cases, all against Covenant targets.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] So he’s not just stealing armaments, he’s recruiting. At the moment he’s still using guerilla tactics, which means he’s still small time. Still, I’m impressed he’s still alive. If he’s got a grudge against the Covenant we may be able to use his attacks to our advantage, co-ordinate our operations with his raids. See if you can find a pattern, I want us to follow him more closely. Who knows, we may be able to come to some kind of agreement.&lt;/b&gt;</str>

&lt;b&gt; ['D']…what’s the name of the ship? Something pronounceable, I hope.&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] ‘The &lt;i&gt;Enduring Conviction&lt;/i&gt;’, sir. A CAS-class assault carrier. The Conviction and its Sangheili commander have been known to us for some time, we’ve lost quite a few ships to it over the last four years. According to our intel it’s the largest ship Atriox controls now.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] He’s amassing quite a fleet. This must be the ninth raid in as many months. Still, he’s never gone for something this large before. How did he raise enough troops to capture and then crew a CAS-class carrier?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] We’re piecing together what we can, sir. From what we understand, Atriox and a small group of his warlords were captured during a raid on a former Covenant air base and taken aboard the &lt;i&gt;Enduring Conviction&lt;/i&gt;. Twelve hours later, &lt;i&gt;Enduring Conviction&lt;/i&gt; broke formation and contact with the rest of the fleet it travelled with. The &lt;i&gt;Conviction&lt;/i&gt; was hailed, warned, and then fired upon when it ignored orders. The &lt;i&gt;Conviction&lt;i&gt; performed evasive maneuvers, returned fire and escaped. It was an impressive move…and it’s one we’ve seen before during a battle with the &lt;i&gt;Conviction&lt;/i&gt; two years ago.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Are you implying the commander was still in control?&lt;/b&gt; 

['S'] It’s possible, sir. It’s unclear who’s giving orders to these Sangheili ships now and his crew was fiercely loyal. If we knew that, then Atriox would have. What if Atriox planned to be captured by the &lt;i&gt;Conviction&lt;/i&gt; so he could get close to the commander and get him to defect? It may have even already been planned and this was just a cover.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] An assault carrier and its crew. Atriox has just painted a very large target on his back, he’s going to want to lay low for a while. Keep track of known Sangheili, let’s see if this snowball turns into an avalanche.&lt;/b&gt;</str>

&lt;b&gt;['D'] What are these? Wraith tanks? What’s this other vehicle? I don’t recognize it.&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Not many people would, sir. Those are Banished Wraiths, the other thing we’re not sure about, some kind of airborne artillery. With the war over, there’s an awful lot of materiel out there for the taking. No Covenant also means Atriox can stop running. 

&lt;b&gt;['D'] But if the Covenant are gone what’s he fighting for? I guess he could be making a bid for Doisac. Brutes don’t have a strong leader to stabilize them since the wars ended, and that’s a good thing. &lt;/b&gt;

['S'] I don’t think so, sir. Throughout the war he was always about raiding, about building up his army. He never struck directly against the Covenant unless there was something to gain from it. Never took territory, never made demands or speeches. He kept as low as he could, a small target. Now his targets have become more focused, less hit and runs than surgical strikes. And he’s still recruiting. Even some of the Lekgolo are joining him now as well as more ex-Covenant who don’t want to stop fighting. The Covenant was never the target. They were just convenient suppliers. He’s just getting started.</str>

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Play it back to me, let me hear what we got.&lt;/b&gt;

“You wish to know about Atriox and his Banished? The Covenant’s dirty little secret. The Jiralhanae they could not control. When I joined the Covenant I was young and easily led. Even back then he had already passed into legends and whispers. A monstrous savage who railed against those who would show us the way to the Great Journey. What a fool I was. 
I was there when they tried to execute him. Many have said the same but I speak the truth. His crime was to question the Great Journey. To question the Prophets as they sent wave after wave of his kind to die. With each battle he became harder, his dissent louder until the Covenant had to silence him. 

He was to be executed for heresy; for bringing shame upon the Covenant and doubt to weak willed minds. I was working some menial task nearby when they brought him in, bloodied and fresh from the fight. He showed no fear – it was as if there was too much rage inside him for any other emotion. As the executor brought down his blade, Atriox rose, killing his would be killer. The other Brutes fell upon the rest of the guards – such savagery. Years later I heard Atriox had engaged the services of the Enduring Conviction. 

I wonder, would the war have ended sooner had he led the Covenant? Or would it still be raging? I say this – do not underestimate him. I know you humans. There is honor in you, but there is equally deceit and I know how you nurture your plots. If you try and harness his power, he will burn you. Atriox works for no one. He may not be the Covenant, but he is not your tool.” 

['S'] That was all we could get out of the Sangheili, sir. He wouldn’t say any more without us answering some uncomfortable questions so we let him go.</str>

['S'] Sir, it’s me. We’ve lost him. He’s completely disappeared.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] You can drop the ‘sir’, I’m not your boss anymore, remember? I take it I know which ‘him’ we’re talking about?&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Every one of my sources say the trail has gone cold, those that are still answering my calls anyway. Without ONI channels at my disposal the only people talking are those who owe me favors.

&lt;b&gt;['D'] They don’t need us now their war’s over. Forget about it.&lt;/b&gt;

['S'] Forget it? Atriox has assembled an army somewhere out there and we still don’t know what he’s after. I’ve got connections on Doisac and he’s become a symbol to the Jiralhanae, a new leader to rally around. While we’ve been fighting the Covenant he’s been growing and gathering his forces. The last time we heard from him he had captured a whole host of Huragok. Forerunner engineers. You know what those things can do?

&lt;b&gt;['D'] Listen, I stopped caring when they cut me out. They pull me up on a few shady deals after what they did with the Spartan IIs? Hypocrites. They ask you to get your hands dirty and then they’re too good to shake your hand. The only reason I’m not in some detention station is the stuff I have on them. So let them find out about Atriox in their own time. Don’t call here again, we’re done.&lt;/b&gt;</str>

	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.AMBER">A translucent amber-like material covers much of the terrain in this unforgiving Refugia. Petrified rivers and lakes form vast, planar surfaces which are only broken by the angular, jutting rock formations that puncture the surface.  

Fractures that have splintered into deep chasms reveal the complex Forerunner infrastructure below, and geometrical veins from these underlying structures can be seen striping the upper layers. In places the strong but brittle amber has sheared and degraded into sand, which is then whipped up and sculpted by the wind into dune seas where life struggles to take root. 

What life can survive here is extremely alien; huge and bizarre flora spring up through cracks in the rocks, swaying in the breeze and belching spores into the atmosphere if disturbed.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.ARK">A gigantic structure situated outside of any known star system, the Ark was constructed by the Forerunners with two guiding principles. First, to fabricate, repair and transport all components of the ringworld installations known collectively as Halo, a weapon designed to wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy in a desperate attempt to stop the parasitic Flood. Secondly, it needed to be able to provide a safe and stable habitat for a vast number of life forms collected from across the galaxy.

These two paradigms led to the unique, flower-like design, with immense arms splayed around a central foundry, where the production of the Halo installations occurs. The Ark’s surface was covered by vast, world-sized paddocks called refugia, divided by massive walls and containment barriers to preserve the life forms collected by the Librarian as part of her Conservation Measure, to be reseeded after the Flood had been starved out.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.CARTOGRAPHER">The Cartographer is one of many identically named map facilities on the Ark, updated in real time with the latest dynamic cartographic and diagnostic information. This includes security measures activated on the Ark, any required maintenance of the various refugias, the structural integrity of the Ark’s superstructure and its artificial sun, and the status of the Halo array and any new installations being forged in the Foundry.

In the wrong hands the Cartographer is an incredibly dangerous source of information, so it is hidden deep in a remote wasteland, heavily guarded by Sentinels and protected by huge defensive barriers. The Sentinels guarding the Cartographer are much more likely to attack interlopers on sight rather than wait for provocation and only someone with the appropriate command clearance can access the Cartographer without a fight.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.CITADEL">The Ark has several supraluminal communication towers with the purpose of transmitting data to and from the weapon installations that make up the Halo Array. 

Each Halo has a designated Control Room which activates the Halo’s weapon systems upon receiving the data, as well as emergency shutdown protocols to disable the systems and halt the Halo’s activation. 

Like the Cartographer, these Control Rooms are often protected by a large energy barrier and patrolled by high security Sentinels to protect from misuse. The Control Room is integral to the maintenance of the Halo’s weapon systems, and the interior leads deep down to the Halo’s superstructure in a maze of winding tunnels and shifting walls.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.FORERUNNER">The Ark continues to rebuild itself after the destruction wrought by the battle that ended the Covenant War. Like icebergs, the Forerunner constructions on the surface are only a tiny part of the whole.

Partial-printing creates a terraced landscape of plateaus supported by colossal columns and the substructure of the Ark dominates the space with gigantic vertigo-inducing cavities that allow views deep into the superstructure beneath. The surface demonstrates the building techniques and foundations of a refugia still being terraformed, with the layered strata giving a tantalizing hint of the Forerunners’ unfinished design.

Even incomplete, the exposed vein-like layers have a raw beauty of their own and complement the sleek and sculptured metallic lines of finished Forerunner architecture nearby. Mineral deposits with exotic material properties scatter the surface, and new paths are created by massive shifting plates, their purpose known only to the long dead race that created them.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.FOUNDRY">The Foundry is a massive circular machine situated at the epicenter of the Ark for the purpose of constructing and repairing the ringworlds that make up the Halo Array. 

Within its center it holds a mineral-rich moon in a powerful gravitational field that is mined for resources by giant Retriever Sentinels, then used by Assembler Sentinels to build components of a Halo. The Halo Array is always made of seven ringworlds and should one be destroyed the Ark starts building a replacement. 

Once a Halo is stable, it is released to the same location as the destroyed Halo to replace it while Sentinels continue to work on it. Of the seven ringworlds that make up the Halo Array, six have originated on the Ark, while the seventh was constructed on an earlier version of the Ark and later reconstructed to fit the new design.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.HALO">A Halo is an artificial, planet-sized ringworld weapon, created by the ancient Forerunner race as a weapon to combat the parasitic entity known as the Flood. 

Despite millennia of scientific and philosophical advancements, the Forerunners were unable to stop the spread of the Flood as it propagated across numerous life-forms through infection. After many defeats, the only answer was to starve the Flood by denying its ability to infect anything – by destroying all sentient life. 

The Ark was built to construct, maintain and activate the ringworlds that make up the Halo Array weapon, and seven ringworlds were launched at strategic points across the galaxy. The Halo Array was fired, wiping out all sentient life without damaging the inhabitant’s worlds and the Flood retreated. 

However, towards the end of the Human-Covenant War, the Halo Array once again became an ever present menace, the weapon to end all wars.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.HALOREFUGIA">This Refugia is at once familiar and otherworldly. Many areas resemble the lands of Earth; lush, verdant landscapes, tranquil sandy beaches where waves lap gently at the shore and stunning waterfalls plunge endlessly over high cliffs. 

There is mountainous moorland, jagged rocky slopes and outcroppings covered in a light shrub. But the immense scale of the environment imposes itself, dwarfing each of its Earthly equivalents. The chasms are deeper and darker, the mountains higher and even the sea and sky seem a richer blue than Earth’s atmosphere. 

As ominous reminders colossal Forerunner bridges bisect the terrain and gigantic unknown structures dominate the skyline, their purposes unknown but their very silence and mystery resonating with power.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.OUTPOST">The Henry Lamb Research Outpost was the base of a UNSC scientific research expedition to learn about the Ark, both in the interest of scientific advancement and self-preservation from future Halo threats.

The expedition was spurred on by the re-activation of the existing Halo array in 2555 by the Ark’s Monitor, Tragic Solitude. A team travelled to the Ark and stopped Tragic Solitude’s plan to aggressively mine the Earth for materials to rebuild the Ark, which had been damaged as a result of the battle that ended the Covenant War.

In 2557, a new team travelled through the portal near New Mombasa in their ship &lt;i&gt;Eden Rising&lt;/i&gt;, with the goal of activating dormant Retriever Sentinels in order to start repairing the Ark. These researchers established an outpost expansion in February of 2558. In October of that year, the portal to Earth closed, followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of the Banished fleet. The base and its outlying facilities were all razed by the Banished attack.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.PARTICLECANNON">The Particle Cannon is a long dormant but extremely powerful Forerunner weapon, built in the early stages of the Ark’s construction when it was most vulnerable to a pre-emptive attack by the Flood. 

Once the Ark’s construction had been completed, it lay dormant until its location was discovered in the Cartographer by Professor Anders. The cannon has been designed to protect against orbital attacks and draws its power directly from the Ark itself through a series of conduits located underneath the Ark’s surface. Ionized particles are charged until they reach high-density, allowing it to fire an incredibly long range and continuous particle beam at its target.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.REFUGIA">The Ark was originally created to build Halos, gigantic weapons that wipe out all sentient life in order to starve the parasitic Flood of life to infect. This desperate measure conflicted with the Forerunners' roles as custodians of the galaxy, and so it was decided that the Ark would also preserve examples of doomed species so they could be reseeded once the Flood had been eradicated.

The surface of the Ark was divided up into vast refugia sections, twelve on the Central Hub and twenty across the large, petal-like Spires that extend out from the center. Each refugia recreates the environments of common life-supporting worlds and separates sub-environments with by huge walls monitored by Sentinels to protect one ecosystem from polluting another. The Ark monitors and controls weather, temperature and even natural food chains in order to maintain the habitat.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.THEARK.BODY.SENTINELS">Sentinels were created by Forerunners as automated worker and defense drones to maintain and protect their installations from transgressors. Although designed without the independent intelligence of Monitors, or the UNSC’s smart AI, they remain highly adaptable and a formidable foe to anything they recognize as a threat to the Ark.

The Foundry at the center of the Ark is populated by Retriever and Assembler Sentinels, who extract resources and minerals from the small moon held there. The mining capabilities of the ship-size Retriever Sentinels can be highly destructive when used against trespassers, but it is the smaller Aggressor Sentinels that are primarily used for enforcement. 

When deployed in great numbers, these Sentinels will swoop in and attack as one in a perfectly coordinated wave, swiftly removing any threats while leaving the Ark undamaged.</str>

	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.ATRIOX">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vicious and cunning warmaster of the Banished.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Leader and creator of the Banished, Atriox is a fearsome warrior who rose to power through his fierce tenacity and shrewd strategic planning honed during the Human-Covenant conflict. 

Atriox holds an extremely pragmatic view of warfare and understands the importance of supporting infrastructures and how to build armies and structures cheaply and efficiently. 

His charisma and the fervor of his followers make it possible for Atriox to deploy both savage Brutes and Elite mercenaries simultaneously, whereas other leaders would struggle to control such bitter rivals on the battlefield.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.ATRIOXCHOSEN">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atriox's enforcers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Only the most cunning and loyal Brutes are chosen as Atriox’s personal enforcers. Their unquestioning devotion to Atriox makes them a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and personal &lt;b&gt;energy shields&lt;/b&gt; make them even harder to kill. Each Chosen is armed with the &lt;b&gt;explosive grenade launcher&lt;/b&gt; commonly known as a &lt;b&gt;Brute Shot&lt;/b&gt;, which can be upgraded to increase both &lt;b&gt;damage and range.&lt;/b&gt;

Favored chieftains in Atriox’s retinue may be promoted to Atriox’s Chosen, agents that intercede on his behalf to bring recalcitrant packs to heel and direct critical Banished operations. Answerable only to Atriox , these warriors are feared by lesser Brutes and hated by the Shipmaster’s troops, but none can deny their loyalty or ability to detect and destroy weak links in Banished operations. Many a prideful chieftain who dared question Atriox's command have ended up as a problem ‘fixed’ by one of Atriox’s inner circle.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.BANSHEE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Multi-role attack aircraft.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Banshee is a versatile attack aircraft armed with anti-aircraft &lt;b&gt;plasma cannons&lt;/b&gt; and a ground attack &lt;b&gt;fuel rod cannon&lt;/b&gt;. The fuel rod cannon can be upgraded to fire a powerful tracking plasma torpedo that is surprisingly effective against air units.

The earliest models of Banshees were modelled after the ‘sKelln, a leathery winged flying predator from the Sangheili homeworld, Sanghelios. The Banished have twisted this ancient ancestry to make it look similar to an aerial predator hailing from their own homeworld, Doisac.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.BLISTERBACK">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A heavy air unit that launches barrages of plasma missiles.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The tick-like Blisterback is a massive aerial siege vehicle utilized by the Banished.  It is designed to alternate between two modes: On the ground it &lt;b&gt;deploys&lt;/b&gt; to fire &lt;b&gt;Annihilator siege missiles&lt;/b&gt;, and while in the air it fires &lt;b&gt;medium plasma cannons&lt;/b&gt; that can engage ground and air targets.

On the ground the Blisterback enters a lockdown mode, stabilizing itself before its carapace splits open, revealing a battery of long range rockets. It can then exit lockdown mode to become airborne, closing the rocket carapace and tucking its legs underneath its body to perform a vertical take-off and enabling the use of its medium range plasma cannon to bombard the enemy.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.CHOPPER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aggressive scout and anti-infantry vehicle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Brute counterpart to the Ghost, Choppers are durable raiding vehicles that can deal out punishment with its twin &lt;b&gt;spiker autocannons&lt;/b&gt; and ability to &lt;b&gt;ram&lt;/b&gt; enemy forces that approach too close. The spike cannons can be upgraded with &lt;b&gt;shrapnel rounds&lt;/b&gt; for additional explosive punch.

The Chopper gets its name from sharp rotary blades mounted at the front of the chassis to ram enemy vehicles and shred ground troops, a savage tactic reflective of Brute culture. Choppers are so popular among the Banished that competition to become a driver in the outrider squadrons is a major source of death and injury among Atriox’s packs.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.DECIMUS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Right hand of Atriox.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Decimus is one of Atriox’s most trusted chiefs, though he secretly continues to harbor belief in the divinity of the Forerunners. A prime example of Brute power and rage, Decimus’ bloodlust whips troops under his command into a frenzied rampage and his chieftain’s hammer can be wielded to unleash a devastating gravity vortex. 

As befitting his rank, Decimus has his own personal Brute Warlord lieutenants but he also relishes the chance to make a personal appearance on the field against particularly stubborn enemies.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.ENGINEERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enigmatic living machines with remarkable repair abilities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Engineers are non-combat infantry support units that can &lt;b&gt;heal&lt;/b&gt; nearby friendly units and structures with their &lt;b&gt;reconstitution beams&lt;/b&gt;. They can float over cliffs and other impediments to escape danger, but have no offensive abilities. Engineers have an ability to create an &lt;b&gt;overshield&lt;/b&gt; bubble to briefly protect itself and nearby allies.

Mysterious living machines created by the Forerunners to function as techno-savants, Engineers have peerless knowledge of all types of technology and seemingly inexhaustible wells of ingenuity in modifying and repairing machinery. 

“Born” with an obsession to maintain and protect Forerunner artifacts, Engineers in the service of the Banished exist in constant agony due to the control yokes bonded to their flesh forcing them to ignore endless requests for maintenance from the Ark as a result of Atriox’s extraction and excavation efforts.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.GHOST">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast scout armed with twin plasma cannons.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Exclusively used by the Shipmaster and Arbiter for their speed and firepower, Ghosts are single-occupant anti-grav speeders armed with &lt;b&gt;twin plasma cannons&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;ram&lt;/b&gt; ability to decimate enemy infantry squads. Ghosts can also negate control over resource nodes. With the &lt;b&gt;ghost shield&lt;/b&gt; upgrade the Ghost becomes a significantly more durable and effective high-speed raider.

The Ghost is one of the most recognizable and ubiquitous vehicles on the battlefield. It is less armored than its Brute counterpart, the Chopper, but this sacrifice grants it nearly unmatched speed. This speed makes it useful for harassing and hit-and-run tactics on the field.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.GRUNTS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expendable minions (and they know it).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Though derided as cannon fodder, there is no mistaking the military value of having an almost endless supply of cheap infantry armed with &lt;b&gt;plasma pistols&lt;/b&gt; to hurl at a foe.  Each Grunt squad is led by a Brute armed with a &lt;b&gt;spike rifle&lt;/b&gt; who can be upgraded to plant a cloaked proximity-fused &lt;b&gt;shrapnel mine&lt;/b&gt; on the battlefield. The Grunts can be upgraded to add a pack brother and lackeys.

Grunts may not be strong, brave, intelligent, hygenic, or particularly fearsome warriors, but those forced to serve the Banished have a healthy enough fear of their Brute leaders to stay on-task and motivated. Even if their fellows are used as target practice by bored Brutes or disintegrated by Forerunner sentinels, the survivors can at least look forward to a full food nipple and a brief nap in the methane atmosphere they call home.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.HONORGUARD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Personal guard of Shipmaster Let ‘Volir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

These mercenaries are the &lt;b&gt;infantry&lt;/b&gt; bodyguard of Let ‘Volir, armed with &lt;b&gt;energy swords&lt;/b&gt; and equipped with &lt;b&gt;active camouflage&lt;/b&gt;. The Honor Guard can &lt;b&gt;cloak&lt;/b&gt; for a limited time, allowing them to close to melee range and engage with their swords. 

Borrowing the ceremonial gear and matching the martial prowess of the old Covenant Honor Guard, these mercenary swordmasters evoke the traditions and accomplishments of their forebears in the service of their Shipmaster and his unconventional arrangement with Atriox and the Banished. Though the Honor Guards’ motives are not as pure as they once were, only a fool would dare risk their wrath by challenging their presumed honor and skill.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.HUNTERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A bonded pair of walking tanks formed from colonies of worm-like aliens.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Hunters are superheavy infantry who fight in bonded pairs. Their massive &lt;b&gt;shields&lt;/b&gt; help protect them from all frontal attacks, and their &lt;b&gt;assault cannons&lt;/b&gt; deal heavy damage to any ground target and to vehicles in particular. Hunters can be upgraded to equip &lt;b&gt;beam cannons&lt;/b&gt; which fire a constant stream of energy at a target.

Hunters are actually just one form taken by Lekgolo worm colonies, with other notable examples including the musculature and control systems for the Scarab and Locust. Always cryptic and undecipherable, Lekgolo in the service of the Banished seem curiously aggressive and the Brutes take great care to separate them from the general population of thralls and mercenaries under their banner to avoid unnecessary carnage. It’s possible the Hunters’ service is not voluntary, though only Atriox’s inner circle knows the truth.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.JUMPPACK">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast-moving assault troops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This Brute heavy infantry unit is equipped with &lt;b&gt;jump packs&lt;/b&gt; and armed with &lt;b&gt;hammers&lt;/b&gt;. The Brutes can leap a great distance with the pack’s assistance, unleashing a crushing attack at their destination that deals area-of-effect damage. Jump Brutes in the service of Atriox also drop &lt;b&gt;trip mines&lt;/b&gt; along their jump path to deter enemy pursuit. All Jump Pack Brute squads can increase their unit size with the &lt;b&gt;dark skies&lt;/b&gt; upgrade.

Favored by Atriox for their mobility and savagery, the Banished make extensive use of Jump Pack Brutes for reconnaissance, hit-and-run harassment, and devastating close-quarters assaults. Though the jump packs cannot provide full flight capabilities and must cool down after each use, they allow the Brute warriors to quickly smash into enemy lines, crushing all who stand against the Banished.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.LICH">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Superheavy deployment platform.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Banished have appropriated Lich transports and repurposed them to function as carriers for the central command structures of their raider bases.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.LOCUST">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Siege walker.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Locust walkers are siege vehicles armed with an &lt;b&gt;unstable focus cannon&lt;/b&gt; that deals continuous damage to buildings and vehicles. Locusts are fitted with &lt;b&gt;energy shields&lt;/b&gt; but are relatively fragile once those shields are depleted. 

One of the many Covenant vehicles modified by the Banished to serve their needs, the Locust is a walker unit originally built for mining and excavation purposes. The Covenant repurposed Locusts to demolish enemy buildings and outposts with sustained bombardment from their focus cannons, but the Banished have managed to make these vehicles even more dangerous than they were before.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.MARAUDER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast, medium tank.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Marauder is an infantry-fighting vehicle armed with a heavy &lt;b&gt;plasma turret&lt;/b&gt;. Marauders can be upgraded with modular plates of &lt;b&gt;thick hide&lt;/b&gt; to increase their staying power in escalating battles, and those in the &lt;b&gt;Shipmaster’s&lt;/b&gt; service can also be fitted with &lt;b&gt;cloak&lt;/b&gt; systems.

Usually operating in close support of Banished infantry, the Marauder is a Jiralhanae design that traces its origins to armored hovercraft that ranged on the plains of Doisac during the world wars that eventually devastated their civilization. The vehicle is also found in the service of the mercenary Shipmaster as a heavier support vehicle for his Ghost raiders.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.RANGERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anti-infantry marksman and skirmishers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Elite Rangers are specialist infantry units devoted to anti-personnel duties. They are armed with rapid-fire &lt;b&gt;carbines&lt;/b&gt; with excellent range. They rely on their mobility to stay out of danger and can often severely diminish enemy forces before being within range of a counterattack. 

Rangers serve as the skirmishers and snipers of the Shipmaster’s mercenary group, tasked with eliminating high-value enemy leaders and scouting routes for his raiding squads. Rangers deploy in pairs that can operate for days, even weeks, away from the main Banished forces. All are hardened raiders and merciless killers who would (and did) sell their own clan if there was profit in it.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.REAVER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anti-aircraft combat walker armed with rapid-fire missile launchers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Reaver is a walker unit unique to the Banished, built to act as a highly mobile counter-air unit. It is armed with &lt;b&gt;Thrasher missile pods&lt;/b&gt; that track on enemy aircraft and a &lt;b&gt;light spiker autocannon&lt;/b&gt; that can deter attack by infantry and light armored vehicles. It can use its &lt;b&gt;Predatory Leap&lt;/b&gt; ability to jump short distances, useful for setting up ambushes or evading attack.

The Reaver is a relatively new addition to the Banished arsenal, and its manufacturer is unknown – though it bears telltale marks of both workshop and assembly vat construction, which hints at an origin on Doisac. They have largely replaced the AA Wraith and anti-aerospace fortifications in the Banished forces, and have quickly earned a dreaded reputation among the Spirit of Fire’s pilots.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.SCARAB">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Superheavy assault walker with devastating excavation beam.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Few weapon platforms strike as much fear into an opponent as Scarabs. Massive and armored with nearly impregnable battleplate, most battles end soon after a Scarab appears. Banished Scarabs are armed with an &lt;b&gt;unstable plasma beam&lt;/b&gt; that deals incredible ground-target damage and &lt;b&gt;Thrasher missiles&lt;/b&gt; for air defense. The Scarab is slow but very mobile and can easily travel up cliffs and across rough terrain.

Scarabs are highly prized excavation vehicles, though in Banished service they are almost exclusively used as war machines. Heavily modified by the Banished to maximize firepower, the unstable plasma generators used in these Scarabs quickly kill the Lekgolo worms that form its control system. Atriox cares not for this sacrifice as long as the Scarabs continue to bring him victories.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.SHIPMASTER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Loyal captain, mercenary raider.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Let ‘Volir is the head of a mercenary Sangheili clan and shipmaster of the assault carrier &lt;i&gt;Enduring Conviction&lt;/i&gt;, the most powerful warship in the Banished fleet.

Atriox engaged the Shipmaster’s forces to bolster his Banished army and provide the aerial advantage and firepower that the Banished were lacking; the &lt;i&gt;Enduring Conviction&lt;/i&gt; can be called upon to unleash orbital plasma bombardments to support Banished ground troops or to destroy or damage enemy structures.

His decision to bind his crew to the Banished has forever tarnished his name in “proper” Elite culture, but the Shipmaster knows that in the current chaotic state of the galaxy “proper” is a luxury not all can afford if they want to keep their crew and their ship intact.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.SHROUD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Support vehicle with cloaking field and point defense system.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

A war machine from the Covenant’s past given new life in Banished service, the Shroud is a support air unit with two combat modes. When &lt;b&gt;deployed&lt;/b&gt;, the Shroud activates a persistent &lt;b&gt;cloaking field&lt;/b&gt; around the vehicle. When not cloaked, the Shroud engages a point defense system that attempts to shoot down incoming enemy projectiles. The Shroud has no offensive capabilities.

The Shroud is difficult to pilot, with complicated subsystems made even less reliable by Banished tinkering, but its utility in concealing and defending raiding parties means Atriox spares no expense in maintaining his stock of the vehicles.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.SPIRIT">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Versatile combat dropship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The distinctive ‘tuning-fork’ shape of the Spirit comes from the twin carrier bays that extend out from the pilot’s compartment at the rear of the ship. The Banished have reengineered the Spirit’s contragravity system so that its chassis can take the strain of transporting prefabricated buildings to forward command centers.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.SUICIDEGRUNTS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grunts with explosive tempers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Suicide Grunts are specially chosen infantry with exaggerated aggressive tendencies. Each Grunt is fitted with an &lt;b&gt;unstable plasma cell&lt;/b&gt; and detonator and given only one order: rush the assigned target and violently explode. They can be upgraded with &lt;b&gt;new “recruits”&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;plasma lensing&lt;/b&gt; which increases their damage against structures and vehicles.

Truly aggressive and violent Grunts are rare, but without Covenant oversight or the environmental hazards of Balaho to cull them from the population, the number of aberrants has increased dramatically in thrall colonies. The Banished have adapted existing indoctrination protocols to turn the aggression and natural cleverness of these Grunts to their own violent purposes.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.WARLORD">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Decimus’ infantry champions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Brute Warlords are among the most fearsome infantry in the Banished forces. They are armed with devastating &lt;b&gt;gravity hammers&lt;/b&gt; and have &lt;b&gt;energy shields&lt;/b&gt; to supplement their already-heavy armor and hides. Their gravity hammers emit a massive &lt;b&gt;shockwave&lt;/b&gt; which damages and stuns all nearby ground units. 

Each Brute that holds the Warlord rank has been promoted by Decimus for their raw strength, savage lust for battle, and the complete absence of mercy on the battlefield. While the Brutes who make up Atriox’s Chosen share their leader’s cunning, Decimus encourages more base traits in his warriors, chief among which is an unquenchable thirst for blood.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSBAN.BODY.WRAITH">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heavy mortar tank.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Wraith is a tank armed with a &lt;b&gt;plasma mortar&lt;/b&gt; for long-range bombardment and short-range &lt;b&gt;plasma cannons&lt;/b&gt; for engaging ground and air units. Wraiths in Banished service are fitted with &lt;b&gt;energy shields&lt;/b&gt;. The Wraith’s can be upgraded to fire a &lt;b&gt;scorch mortar&lt;/b&gt;; the impact of this system’s unstable plasma shells leaves a lingering pool of energy after impact.

Modified to fit the Brutes’ warlike aesthetic, the Wraith serves the Banished as both a mainline tank and artillery piece. Armed with its distinctive plasma mortar the Wraith can shatter heavily reinforced defenses from long distances or engage closer targets with devastating barrages. Despite the Wraith’s large size, its boosted gravity drive allows for impressive bursts of speed and surprisingly agile maneuvers over most terrain.</str>

	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSFORE.BODY.AGRESSSENT">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forerunner Sentinels that can be called in by Anders to cause area denial.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Though their primary purpose is to maintain, repair and protect the Ark, these Forerunner Sentinels can be summoned by Professor Anders, who has found a way to deploy them in the service of the UNSC. Once called, the Sentinels swarm in to a targeted location and attack any hostiles in the area with &lt;b&gt;sentinel beams&lt;/b&gt;, remaining and causing area denial for a duration before returning to their jobs on the Ark. Any Sentinels that are destroyed emit an EMP blast, crippling hostile vehicles temporarily.

The Sentinels are worker drones with basic AI, created by the Forerunners to safeguard their stations as well as perform repairs and maintenance. There is a large variety of Sentinels in both purpose, size and appearance. There are small Constructor drones used to maintain Forerunner structures, huge Retrievers used for mining and Aggressor drones for attacking any perceived threat. The Sentinels will only attack if they perceive a present threat; otherwise they will happily ignore strangers and carry on with their work.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSFORE.BODY.SENTINELPRIME">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forerunner defense constructs controlled by Professor Anders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Exclusive to Professor Anders&lt;/b&gt;, the Protector Sentinel is a flying Forerunner drone armed with an energy-based &lt;b&gt;sentinel beam&lt;/b&gt; that is effective against all enemies. It can be upgraded to a &lt;b&gt;sentinel swarm&lt;/b&gt;, which adds smaller Aggressor drones as an escort. Sentinels explode in an &lt;b&gt;EMP blast&lt;/b&gt; upon death, stunning nearby enemy vehicles.

Professor Anders has shown a remarkable ability to manipulate Forerunner command codes and bypass directive locks, giving her the ability to bind the Ark’s own defense constructs to her will. The full extent of her capabilities have yet to be tested, as the Professor’s attention is constantly diverted to more pressing needs like finding a way home.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSFORE.TITLE.AGRESSSENT">Aggressor Sentinel</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSFORE.TITLE.SENTINELPRIME">Protector Sentinel</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.ALICE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genetically augmented humans wearing MJOLNIR armor, the ultimate super-soldier.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Spartans are the crack infantry unit of the UNSC - tough, fast moving and equipped with a rapidly recharging &lt;b&gt;energy shield&lt;/b&gt; when not in combat. Their enhanced agility and strength enables them to leap high into the air before &lt;b&gt;slamming&lt;/b&gt; into the ground, either to take out an enemy, place an explosive device on an enemy structure or even &lt;b&gt;hijack&lt;/b&gt; a vehicle. 

Spartan Alice-130 can be upgraded to heft a medium range, rapid-firing &lt;b&gt;heavy machine gun&lt;/b&gt;.

Alice-130 grew up on the way station colony of Passage, where she amazed her family by quickly learning rudimentary engineering at an early age. This exceptional aptitude marked her out from the rest of the children and she was flagged up as a potential candidate for the SPARTAN-II program. 

Like all the candidates, she was abducted from her family for secret training, but she was one of the few children who weren't traumatized during the process. In fact, Alice actually relished and thrived on the challenge, a natural Spartan if there ever was one. Despite eagerly embracing her destiny, Alice's body initially rejected the augmentation process and she had to be retrained separately, where she met similar 'wash outs' Douglas-042 and Jerome-092, her future partners in Red Team. Alice lives for combat and challenge and can often appear reckless, but this is in actuality an utmost belief in her abilities.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.ANDERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brilliant and fearless scientist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Professor Ellen Anders is one of the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s most valuable weapons, a brilliant scientist with expertise in fields as far ranging as theoretical xeno-biopsychology and high-energy physics. She has also proven to have an exceptional grasp of Forerunner technology and has displayed a command of the Ark's control systems which impresses even Isabel.

Although her official designation remains ‘civilian consultant’, Professor Anders has become the de-facto right hand and advisor of Captain Cutter on the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; and has also earned the respect and trust of the troops she works with in the field.

Anders is able to theorize the function and determine the use of almost any alien technology. She has displayed a particular affinity for controlling Forerunner constructs, and can redirect the Ark’s own drones for her own use as well as manipulate their actions with specialized instruments of her own design.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.CONDOR">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slipspace-capable cargo dropship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Condor is long-range transport vessel used by the UNSC and many civilian agencies, and those that survived the Banished attack at the Ark were redeployed to the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; to deploy prefabricated base modules in lieu of the ship’s original complement of Heron dropships. These are valuable vessels, for they possess slipspace drive cores, although the Ark’s extreme distance from UNSC space mean they can only be used to explore outlying Forerunner installations and conduct long-range reconnaissance rather than make trips back to Earth.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.CONDORGUNSHIP">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slow-moving but heavily armed and armored gunship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Condor is a slow-moving but powerful gunship variant of the civilian dropship armed with multiple &lt;b&gt;pulse laser turrets&lt;/b&gt; and a Ballista mini-&lt;b&gt;Magnetic Accelerator Cannon (MAC)&lt;/b&gt;, all of which can independently target enemy units. The pulse lasers fire quickly, making them effective against massed units, and the MAC is unmatched in hard target elimination. It can be upgraded with a &lt;b&gt;heavy gauss barrage&lt;/b&gt;, which fires three quick MAC blasts at enemy targets.

Condor gunships produced on the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; lack the slipspace drive found on the base dropship, however, with those systems replaced by older, bulkier, capacitors Isabel used to power the pulse lasers and magnetic accelerator cannon.

The G81 Heavy Gunship, Isabel’s reconfiguration of the Condor transport, breaks a large number of UNSC weapons platform and other safety regulations, but she’s pretty sure Captain Cutter will have her back if they survive the war on the Ark.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.CUTTER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Captain of the Spirit of Fire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Captain James Cutter is a leader steeped in military tradition and discipline, but who balances that tradition with a genuine compassion and interest for those who serve underneath him.

A true hero of the UNSC, Cutter’s military career is long and distinguished and he has sacrificed advancement up the ranks in order to remain with his crew and ship. The crew on the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; are more than soldiers to the captain, they are his extended family. Cutter’s respect is reciprocated by his troops, who place a great deal of faith in the captain and his decisions.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.CYCLOPS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anti-tank combat walker.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Cyclops suits are armored infantry exoskeletons armed with an &lt;b&gt;anti-vehicle autocannon&lt;/b&gt; effective against most ground units. The autocannon can be upgraded to fire &lt;b&gt;shock rounds&lt;/b&gt; with non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse warheads that slow the movement of target vehicles. Cyclops suits benefit from infantry upgrades but are as durable as most light vehicles.

Radically redesigned by Serina using design files from Lethbridge Industrial that she inadvertently “found” during operations on Arcadia, the HRUNTING Mk.III Cyclops suits produced aboard the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; now use a refactored exoskeleton and completely original control software. Though this combat walker variant does not have the raw strength of the original engineering vehicle, it is faster and far easier to operate even with its new weaponry and armor. Isabel continues to improve on the design with modern UNSC cyberlink protocols and module concepts.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.DARTER">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Utility cargo dropship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Darters are cargo dropships that form the backbone of the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s logistical system. Darters are loaded with carefully packaged cargo pallets and passengers aboard the Spirit of Fire. They are then launched to firebases in the combat zone, dropping off vital supplies and returning with injured personnel and strategic resources. A steady stream of Darters is vital for the just-in-time warfighting strategy of UNSC expeditionary operations on hostile worlds.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.DOUGLAS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genetically augmented humans wearing MJOLNIR armor, the ultimate super-soldier.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Spartans are the crack infantry unit of the UNSC - tough, fast moving and equipped with a rapidly recharging &lt;b&gt;energy shield&lt;/b&gt; when not in combat. Their enhanced agility and strength enables them to leap high into the air before &lt;b&gt;slamming&lt;/b&gt; into the ground, either to take out an enemy, place an explosive device on an enemy structure or even &lt;b&gt;hijack&lt;/b&gt; a vehicle. 

Douglas-042 can be upgraded with his specialist weapon, which is a long range, slow firing &lt;b&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/b&gt;.

Douglas-042 had a tough time adjusting to the SPARTAN-II program as he had originally come from an affluent family in Khetleya on the Asphodel colony. He found the sudden culture shock difficult to adjust to, but soon focused that anger into a quiet confidence in his physical ability - even among the other Spartans Douglas is considered something of a giant, and he started to believe that he had a purpose in life. 

This faith in destiny has given Douglas more of an optimistic outlook in life than the guarded cynicism common among other Spartans, and it is this hopefulness that helps lift their spirits in hard times.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.HELLBRINGERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anti-infantry Marines armed with flamethrowers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Each Hellbringer carries a &lt;b&gt;heavy flamethrower&lt;/b&gt; which deals area of effect damage against close range targets. The flamethrower is very effective against infantry – even those garrisoned in structures – but is of limited use against armored vehicles. The flamethrower can be upgraded with &lt;b&gt;dispersion nozzles&lt;/b&gt; that increase damage and size of the flame sheets.

Marines willing to strap a tank of volatile chemicals to their back to fire a jet of super-heated flame at enemies are braver (and crazier) than most. Though the UNSC adopted thermobaric munitions for deploying most incendiaries, the liquid projector flamethrower proved its worth to the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;i&gt;’s combat teams by burning out dug-in Covenant infantry, sterilizing Flood infestations, and heating up decades-old MREs.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.HORNET">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast, nimble, multi-role attack VTOL.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Hornets are fast-attack aerial gunships used for combat reconnaissance and lightning strikes against high-priority targets. They are armed with &lt;b&gt;rotary autocannons&lt;/b&gt; that are effective against all targets and can be upgraded with Marine &lt;b&gt;wingmen&lt;/b&gt; carrying &lt;b&gt;rocket launchers&lt;/b&gt;.

Air operation directors from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; are fond of the AV-14B Hornet’s firepower, but they are also very much aware of the vehicle’s relative fragility. Marine pilots often mitigate this issue by operating in Hornet “wolfpack” kill teams to overwhelm air defenses and destroy their targets before retaliatory fire can do much damage. Commanders are advised to wait for the SPNKR-armed wingmen and personally direct the assault when using Hornet swarms against heavily defended facilities.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.ISABEL">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smart artificial intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Isabel is a smart AI originally assigned to the Henry Lamb Research Outpost to guide the activation and direction of the installation’s massive Retriever Sentinels used to conduct repairs on the Ark.

Before long, those Retriever Sentinels were able to work unsupervised and Isabel and the team set to the immense task of researching and cataloging the Ark. This work was tragically cut short by the unexpected closure of the portal to Earth and the Banished’s assault. Now she has been given a chance to strike back at the Banished with the aid of the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s factories.

Isabel’s vast knowledge of technology and military science gives her an edge when using and improving vehicles as well as making use of subterfuge and disruption tactics on the battlefield.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.JACKRABBIT">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast reconnaissance trike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Jackrabbit, or M121 Light Strike Vehicle, is a very fast scout vehicle that can &lt;b&gt;detect&lt;/b&gt; cloaked enemy units and rapidly gather resources. It can be upgraded with a &lt;b&gt;mini-frag launcher&lt;/b&gt; for some offensive punch, but is frequently used for exploration and liberating resource nodes from opponents. 

Cheap and easy to manufacture, the Jackrabbit’s design blueprint was one of the first to be integrated by the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; after Isabel’s rescue. At first glance it looks like a lightly armored bike with a compact cockpit for the rider, but when decelerating the front splits into two separate wheels to form a tripod and retain stability. When bursts of speed are required, the two wheels pinion together automatically.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.JEROME">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genetically augmented humans wearing MJOLNIR armor, the ultimate super-soldier.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Spartans are the crack infantry unit of the UNSC - tough, fast moving and equipped with a rapidly recharging &lt;b&gt;energy shield&lt;/b&gt; when not in combat. Their enhanced agility and strength enables them to leap high into the air before &lt;b&gt;slamming&lt;/b&gt; into the ground, either to take out an enemy, place an explosive device on an enemy structure or even &lt;b&gt;hijack&lt;/b&gt; a vehicle.

Though every Spartan has an instinctive mastery over all weapons, each of the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;'s Red Team can be upgraded with their favored weapon. In Jerome’s case this is a &lt;b&gt;Spartan laser&lt;/b&gt; which is highly accurate and powerful, but has a slow reload rate.

Senior Chief Petty Officer Jerome-092 was born into poverty in the infamous Palaikos borderlands on the colony world of Minister, a tough world that forced him into an early childhood of crime where he also realized his capacity for violence. He was abducted and indoctrinated into the SPARTAN-II program, where, after many initial escape attempts, he was transformed from a self-centered survivalist to a leader, honing the speed and agility that kept him alive back home.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.KODIAK">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Self-propelled artillery gun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Kodiak artillery systems are armed with long-range &lt;b&gt;siege cannons&lt;/b&gt;, though the vehicle must &lt;b&gt;deploy&lt;/b&gt; before it can fire. Deployed Kodiaks cannot move, which means that they are best paired with other units to act as spotters. &lt;b&gt;Professor Anders&lt;/b&gt; can fit the Kodiak with beacon warheads that act as &lt;b&gt;Sentinel lures&lt;/b&gt;, attracting and antagonizing the Ark’s defense constructs.

A modern UNSC vehicle introduced to the Spirit of Fire by Isabel, the Kodiak M400 Artillery System has quickly become a favorite of the ship’s crew on account of the Kodiak’s spectacular firepower. When the Kodiak enters lockdown mode, the articulated ‘feet’ from the side of the vehicle fold down to anchor the vehicle to the ground to provide stability and counter the recoil of the siege cannon. The cannon’s shells are massive and take some time to reload between firing, but the devastation they cause is well worth the wait.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.MARINES">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basic infantry units who can take-and-hold fortifications or activate Forerunner artifacts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

UNSC Marine infantry are armed with &lt;b&gt;assault rifles&lt;/b&gt; that are effective against infantry but deal little damage against ground vehicles. They can receive additional reinforcements and supplies in the field, including the ability to throw &lt;b&gt;grenades&lt;/b&gt; or assigning a &lt;b&gt;combat mechanic&lt;/b&gt; to the squad. The mechanic will automatically &lt;b&gt;repair nearby damaged vehicles&lt;/b&gt; and is armed with an anti-tank &lt;b&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/b&gt;.

Marines are the UNSC’s expeditionary force-in-readiness, and after decades in cryo-sleep they are old school both figuratively and literally. The &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s veteran Marines are experienced at fighting in exotic environments and have received training by Anders to operate Forerunner systems well enough to avoid triggering defense wards and immolating themselves (most of the time).</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.NIGHTINGALE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Medical and maintenance support aircraft.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Nightingales support UNSC forces on the ground with their complement of multi-purpose &lt;b&gt;restoration drones&lt;/b&gt;, which automatically deploy to &lt;b&gt;heal and repair&lt;/b&gt; nearby allied units. Nightingales can also deploy multi-spectrum &lt;b&gt;defensive smoke&lt;/b&gt; as an ability, which blocks enemy line of sight. The Nightingale is unarmed, and should never be deployed without an escort.

The Nightingale EV-44 Support VTOL is one of the newest UNSC support aircraft used by Air Force rescue squadrons and Marine combat logistic teams, and its relatively simple construction (aside from the drone systems) made the design blueprint easy to adapt to the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s older factory modules. As the ship’s complement of troops cannot be replenished, vehicles such as the Nightingale are essential for keeping as many bodies in the fight as possible.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.ODST">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elite rapid-deployment infantry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) are elite infantry that make quick work of any nearby enemy troops with their &lt;b&gt;silenced SMGs&lt;/b&gt;. ODST’s can place a proximity-fused &lt;b&gt;demolition charge&lt;/b&gt; and deploy from orbit anywhere in explored territory using the &lt;b&gt;ODST drop leader power&lt;/b&gt;. Other units in the drop zone may take damage from the ODSTs’ meteoric arrival.

A special forces raiding unit of the Marines, ODSTs are deployed from the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; to turn the tide of battles, raid enemy bases, and assassinate high-value targets. A normal ODST day entails a hair-raising drop from orbit while encased in an armored drop pod. The ODST’s enter the atmosphere at high speed and brake just short of impact. Because of the speed with which they enter the atmosphere, the pods get extraordinarily hot, giving ODSTs the nickname 'Helljumpers' and their slogan “Feet first into Hell!”</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.PELICAN">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Military transport dropship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

A workhorse of the UNSC, Pelican dropships are used by military and civilian agencies throughout human space. Produced in bewildering numbers with dozens of major variants they form the backbone of all medium-lift operations made by the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;. Though they can be used to hot-drop troops and vehicles to a combat zone, the ever-present threat of Banished anti-aerospace cannons deployed near conflict areas means Captain Cutter has strictly limited their tactical utilization.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.SCORPION">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Main battle tank.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Scorpion is armed with a &lt;b&gt;high velocity cannon&lt;/b&gt; for anti-tank work and a &lt;b&gt;medium machine gun&lt;/b&gt; for engaging enemy infantry. Scorpions in the field can be upgraded with submunition &lt;b&gt;canister shells&lt;/b&gt; that deal heavy damage in a blast radius around their target.

The &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; carries a large complement of M808S Scorpion tanks modified by Serina during the years in which the ship drifted in space. Her improvements include a more efficient armor arrangement, better situational awareness for the operator, and upgrades to the main cannon. Isabel has found little room for improvement on this blueprint, but she sees possibilities for specialized variants that leverage the chassis for other roles.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.SNIPERS">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stealthy reconnaissance and marksman unit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Snipers are specialized infantry units armed with a &lt;b&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/b&gt; and accompanied by a &lt;b&gt;spotter drone&lt;/b&gt;. Snipers are equipped with cloaking tech, which they can use to camouflage themselves as they scout out enemy targets. The base rifle is only effective against infantry , but the &lt;b&gt;Stanchion&lt;/b&gt; upgrade arms the Sniper with a portable railgun that deals heavier damage against ground troops.

Drawn from experienced Marine force reconnaissance and Army cavalry scouts, the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s sniper teams have traditionally operated in the background as unsung heroes of many skirmishes and aerial strikes. Equipped with photoreactive cloaks and deceptive jammers, Snipers are extremely difficult to detect until they prepare to strike. After a sniper engages, a canny commander should redeploy them to another vantage point to avoid retaliatory fire.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.VULTURE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ground-attack gunship with tactical missile payload.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

AC-220 Vulture gunships engage ground vehicles with &lt;b&gt;twin medium autocannons&lt;/b&gt;, air vehicles with &lt;b&gt;anti-air missile pods&lt;/b&gt;, and enemy bases and staging areas with &lt;b&gt;Phoenix tactical missiles&lt;/b&gt;.

The Vulture is the largest combat aerodyne in UNSC service and is essentially a flying tank. The size and cost of deploying such a unit limits its use by the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;, though Isabel’s upgrades and logistical expertise has dramatically simplified Vulture production and maintenance.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.WARTHOG">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Utility light attack vehicle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The most versatile vehicle in the UNSC inventory, the Warthog is armed with a &lt;b&gt;autocannon&lt;/b&gt; which can handle all but the most heavily armored vehicles. In a pinch the vehicle can be used to &lt;b&gt;ram&lt;/b&gt; a target, directing the driver to careen into (and ideally over) enemy infantry. The autocannon can be upgraded to a &lt;b&gt;gauss cannon&lt;/b&gt;, which substantially increases the Warthog’s anti-armor capabilities.

The M12 Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, more commonly known as the Warthog, is a quintessentially tough and durable UNSC vehicle, manufactured in one variant or another for centuries. The towing winch system at the front of the vehicle resembles a warthog’s tusks, giving it its name, and it has enhanced suspension and four-wheel steering for a smooth ride over any battlefield. Highly configurable and adaptable, dozens of specialized Warthog loadouts are loaded into the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt;’s datastores, awaiting use.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.CODEX.UNITSUNSC.BODY.WOLVERINE">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Specialized anti-aircraft vehicle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Wolverine is a tactical air defense vehicle, fitted with an advanced &lt;b&gt;Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)&lt;/b&gt;. A &lt;b&gt;secondary grenade launcher&lt;/b&gt; is fitted to engage ground targets, but it is recommended that the Wolverine avoid engaging armored vehicles. 

The Wolverine was reintroduced in the latter years of the insurrection, but it also proved highly effective in countering the Covenant’s Banshee and Seraph fighters. Wolverines aboard the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of Fire&lt;/i&gt; are relatively unsophisticated compared to contemporary variants, but Isabel is making great strides in adapting modern UNSC targeting software to the older hardware.</str>

	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.GETTINGSTARTED">Getting Started</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.GETTINGSTARTED.PARA1">Halo Wars 2 is a fast-paced strategy game with epic battles set in the Halo universe. Build massive armies of diverse units and use their unique abilities to out-think and out-manoeuvre your opponents.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.GETTINGSTARTED.PARA2">There's a lot to explore in Halo Wars 2, but don't be intimidated. Start with the Tutorials to learn the basics and then jump into the Campaign to discover the secrets of the Ark with the Spirit of Fire.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.GETTINGSTARTED.PARA3">When you finish mastering the Campaign, it's time to test what you've learned in Multiplayer. There are different modes to try, including the Versus AI playlist where you team up with other players against AI opponents.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.GETTINGSTARTED.PARA4">Finally, for an interesting twist on strategy games, jump into Blitz - action-packed battles where you collect and play cards to deploy units. Build decks and keep adapting them to outwit other players.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS">Hints and Tips</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.ALLUNITS">If you need to grab every unit quickly, double-tap Right Bumper to select All Units.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.AUTOGATHER">Your units will automatically gather nearby resources or attack enemy units.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.CLOAK">Some units and bases can be cloaked. You can see the shimmer of a cloaked enemy, but if you want to attack them, you'll need a detector nearby.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.RADIALDESCRIPTIONS">Read the radial menu descriptions to learn more about units and upgrades.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.SPENDLP">Keep an eye on your leader points, shown to the top-right of the minimap. If you have any points spare, make sure you spend them.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.SUPPORTUNITS">Some units are support units and don't have weapons, but they are important for keeping your units alive.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.TRAFFICLIGHTS">Every unit has a set of coloured icons in the radial menu or on its Blitz card to indicate what they're strong against. Use these as a rough guide when deciding what to use.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.USECOUNTERUNITS">If your opponent is using too many of a single unit type, punish them with a force of counter-units!</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.USELP">Leader powers can change the course of a fight. If you unlock active powers, remember to use them from the leader power radial menu.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HINTSANDTIPS.VETERANCY">Units gain veterancy as they fight on the battlefield, making them far more effective than new units. Try to keep them alive and they will return the favor.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY">How to play</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.ARMY">Army:</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.ECONOMY">Economy:</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.LEADERPOWERS">Leader Powers:</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.PARA1">Halo Wars 2 is an action-RTS (real-time strategy) game. In Campaign, Multiplayer and Skirmish, you'll have balance managing your economy, army and leader powers as you take the fight to the enemy. The battle dynamics will frequently change on the fly, so knowing the basics will help you to adapt and react.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.PARA2">The core of the economy in Halo Wars 2 are supply and power. You can gather these by constructing certain buildings in your base or by collecting them from objects in the levels. Supply is required to purchase buildings, train core units, and is the primary cost of most specialist units. Power is used to purchase upgrades for units, buildings and is an addtional cost for certain units. As a general rule, if you have enough supply, you'll always be able to field a competent army and, with enough power, you can make that army more lethal and focus on your strengths.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.PARA3">Though there are two factions in Halo Wars 2, both armies work in similar ways. Most units in Halo Wars 2 have a rock-paper-scissors relationship with each other, i.e., vehicles are effective against infantry, air units are effective against vehicles and infantry are effective against air units. Certain units break these rules - these are counter units, which have an edge against specific unit types, but are dangerously weak against everything else. As a general rule, you should aim to have a good mix of unit types, but beware of what your enemy is using.</str>
	<str id="UIGLOB.HELPMENU.HOWTOPLAY.PARA4">Leader Powers are your most powerful weapons in the game. During each campaign mission and multiplayer match, you'll earn leader points. You can spend these in the leader power radial (accessed with the Left Trigger) to unlock active and passive leader powers. Passive powers will provide a constant boost to your armies once unlocked while active powers need to be used from the radial at the expense of supply and/or power resources. Each leader has unique mix of powers, so spend some time exploring each of them - you'll find defensive boosts, healing auras, and even powerful offensive attacks that will wreck havoc on an unsuspecting foe.</str>
